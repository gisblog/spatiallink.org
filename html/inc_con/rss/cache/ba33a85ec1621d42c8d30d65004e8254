One of the primary objectives of this research is to help rural America find its competitive edge in our rapidly globalizing world. It accompanies another research in a similar vein named "Rural Clusters of Innovation: Berkshires Strategy Project- Driving a Long-Term Economic Strategy" [2006]- a public-private study funded in part by the US Department of Commerce. These 2 studies follow an earlier precursor report titled "Competitiveness in Rural US Regions: Learning and Research Agenda" [2004] led by the Harvard Business School. That report arrived at 2 main conclusions:

? 'Capacity for regional innovation is often driven by industry 'clusters''.
? 'Clusters also significantly enhance the ability of regional economies to build prosperity'.

First, some quick background:

Clusters- industry and region, have been defined as 'broad networks of companies, suppliers, service providers, institutions and organizations in related industries that, together, bring new products or services to a market'. A cluster-based approach provides an effective planning tool for economic development in the rural countryside. Graphically, I can summarize a rural cluster like so:



The research's findings, lessons, conclusions, recommendations and directions that I found relevant are:

? 'Labeling a region around a single cluster or economic activity is too simplistic due to considerable co-location of clusters'
? 'Clusters most strongly associated with higher levels of economic performance are business and financial services; IT and Telecom; and printing and publishing'.
? 'Human capital, as measured by educational attainment, is the primary factor related to differences in income growth among counties'.

This research also underlines the importance of spatial technologies as follows:

? 'Much of the analysis of rural America has been overly simplistic. GIS tools and advanced spatial analyses are not commonly used. It is important that greater use of these powerful approaches be applied to a wide range of issues facing rural America'.
? 'Mapping is particularly helpful to illustrate and communicate data on clusters'.

Some of the maps coming out of this research can be found here.

Anyway, as I see it as a Planner, an uneasy socio-cultural issue remains unenlightened, and that is...

When you take rural America or for that matter rural Anything, and strip it of all its social stereotypes and negatives, you are left with something or end up attracting something that is far from rural- something that will jump, skip and run to the New Yorks of our world in time.

 Rural Anything does not clamor for riches; it does not yearn for the hustle-and-bustle of urban life, or for its smog-filled jam-packed commute traffic, or for that neck-breaking workday; it is not awed by the many skyscrapers of the City on whom it conveniently blames all social ills; none of the multi-cultural nightlife or rebellious ways.

 Rural Anything simply desires simplicity- a dog yawning in the backyard farm; a winding trail to work; free parking; quite and quaint neighborhoods topped by the clichéd church tucked away inside the folds of its countryside; fishing expeditions on weekends; just yearning to stretch on a summery afternoon without having to worry about city-like pollutions and crimes; content only to drift and conform to its tightly-knit value-system.

It is a different "make" of people.

How then do you convince it to join the rat-race?

PS:
? As I see it, Relative Rurality- a measure used in this research, helps answer the age-old question: How far would the dollar go? Roughly, the higher the Relative Rurality, the further the dollar would go

It accompanies another research in a similar vein named "Rural Clusters of Innovation: Berkshires Strategy Project- Driving a Long-Term Economic Strategy" [2006]- a public-private study funded in part by the US Department of Commerce. These 2 studies follow an earlier precursor report titled "Competitiveness in Rural US Regions: Learning and Research Agenda" [2004] led by the Harvard Business School. That report arrived at 2 main conclusions:

? 'Capacity for regional innovation is often driven by industry 'clusters''.
? 'Clusters also significantly enhance the ability of regional economies to build prosperity'.

First, some quick background:

Clusters- industry and region, have been defined as 'broad networks of companies, suppliers, service providers, institutions and organizations in related industries that, together, bring new products or services to a market'. A cluster-based approach provides an effective planning tool for economic development in the rural countryside. Graphically, I can summarize a rural cluster like so:



The research's findings, lessons, conclusions, recommendations and directions that I found relevant are:

? 'Labeling a region around a single cluster or economic activity is too simplistic due to considerable co-location of clusters'
? 'Clusters most strongly associated with higher levels of economic performance are business and financial services; IT and Telecom; and printing and publishing'.
? 'Human capital, as measured by educational attainment, is the primary factor related to differences in income growth among counties'.

This research also underlines the importance of spatial technologies as follows:

? 'Much of the analysis of rural America has been overly simplistic. GIS tools and advanced spatial analyses are not commonly used. It is important that greater use of these powerful approaches be applied to a wide range of issues facing rural America'.
? 'Mapping is particularly helpful to illustrate and communicate data on clusters'.

Some of the maps coming out of this research can be found here.

Anyway, as I see it as a Planner, an uneasy socio-cultural issue remains unenlightened, and that is...

When you take rural America or for that matter rural Anything, and strip it of all its social stereotypes and negatives, you are left with something or end up attracting something that is far from rural- something that will jump, skip and run to the New Yorks of our world in time.

 Rural Anything does not clamor for riches; it does not yearn for the hustle-and-bustle of urban life, or for its smog-filled jam-packed commute traffic, or for that neck-breaking workday; it is not awed by the many skyscrapers of the City on whom it conveniently blames all social ills; none of the multi-cultural nightlife or rebellious ways.

 Rural Anything simply desires simplicity- a dog yawning in the backyard farm; a winding trail to work; free parking; quite and quaint neighborhoods topped by the clichéd church tucked away inside the folds of its countryside; fishing expeditions on weekends; just yearning to stretch on a summery afternoon without having to worry about city-like pollutions and crimes; content only to drift and conform to its tightly-knit value-system.

It is a different "make" of people.

How then do you convince it to join the rat-race?

PS:
? As I see it, Relative Rurality- a measure used in this research, helps answer the age-old question: How far would the dollar go? Roughly, the higher the Relative Rurality, the further the dollar would go

Having earlier missed a similar opportunity for Jack Dangermond due to schedule conflicts, I made sure I was present at this seminar.

On display were the GE Enterprise solutions- Fusion, Server and Enterprise Client. With GE Enterprise, you can sign into multiple servers, grab the most accurate data from each and roll everything into one seamless experience. You may even squeeze your private globe onto a pocket-sized device and strut it out on a field. For a private domain, GE Enterprise can scale upto a healthy 250 concurrent users, or a little less than those supported by a default PostgreSQL 8.X on Windows.

One astounding statistic quoted was the vast number of users GE has been able to accumulate over its short life- approximately 200 million; reportedly many more than those by Google Maps, with nearly 80% for casual uses. And a surprising number, or so we are told, falls in the 45+ age group.

Approximations aside, here's my take:

When you try to fathom the 200 million number, you are reminded yet again how ESRI, Intergraph, MapInfo, Autodesk et al, poorly missed the globe software bandwagon. And the traditional SIS companies still do not have a clear winner when it comes to 3D buildings and surface textures, despite counting 3DS Max and Maya. All that information is what users now expect from any cutting-edge globe software.

From the looks of it and the high-end price tag of over $100,000, Google has smelled blood- the fat inside some governments; ESRI and Intergraph can attest to that. If Google succeeds in this aggressive push, the traditional SIS companies will cede further into the background on data visualization; they are anyway planted firmly in the backseat with regards to a lot of casual uses.

So when you combine this push with GE user groups, the KML offer to OGC, KML-based searches and other enterprise solutions, then you can see why some traditions may be feeling nervous. Add to that the general perception about Google's speed-of-innovation- 'when you use a Google product, Google would innovate faster than the traditional SIS companies to support it'.

As I see it, that growing perception should be the biggest reason for the traditional industry's nervousness.

These steps slowly push one other software- ESRI's ArcGlobe, part of the ArcGIS 3D Analyst extension, further away from all that is important. ArcGlobe was useful in that it eventually led to E2, but ESRI had much bigger plans- it was promoted to become widely adopted for 3D data mapping and visualization.

Then Google came along, and ArcGlobe and all the shabby flyby animations and painstaking multipatches in ArcScene, also part of 3D Analyst, suddenly became embarrassing.

That leads me to my prediction of the week: all this will force ESRI to either lower the inflation-adjusted cost of its pricey 3D Analyst- currently marked at $2500, or absorb some of it into E2 or the desktop. Note that Google Earth Pro today costs a fraction at $400.
