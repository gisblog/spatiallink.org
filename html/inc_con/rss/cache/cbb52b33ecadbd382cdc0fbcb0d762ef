<div class="image illus"><img alt="http://zcologia.com/images/map-before.jpg" class="illus" height="531" src="http://zcologia.com/images/map-before.jpg" width="418"></img></div>
<p >The root resource is at <a class="reference" href="http://zcologia.com:8081/features">http://zcologia.com:8081/features</a>, and the default view is a JSON array of links to objects. (Note: Douglas Crockford has proposed the <em >application/json</em> content type, and I've only used <em >text/plain</em> here to make it easier for people to follow the links in their browsers.) The URLs <a class="reference" href="http://zcologia.com:8081/features.atom">http://zcologia.com:8081/features.atom</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://zcologia.com:8081/features.kml">http://zcologia.com:8081/features.kml</a> return GeoRSS (Atom) and KML representations respectively.</p>
<p >Over the course of several images, I'm going to walk through the process of getting representations of feature resources, and posting new resources to the system.</p>
<p >The first image shows all the features in the system as seen using KML in Google Maps [<a class="reference" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=http://zcologia.com:8081/features.kml&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=6&om=1">link</a>]. More features may have been posted to the system by the time you click on that link, so you may see more points. It's also possible that these particular features here may have popped off, as I've capped the number of features in the system at 30. Like I said, it's just a toy. Only 288 lines of Python.</p>
<p >Now, fire up your RESTful feature service client, and follow my instructions to add a new feature to the system. You've probably got several such clients on your system already. My favorite is good ole vim. Seriously.</p>
<div class="image figure"><img alt="http://zcologia.com/images/getting-template.jpg" class="figure" height="230" src="http://zcologia.com/images/getting-template.jpg" width="670"></img></div>
<p >You can obtain a representation of any of the system's features by reading the output of a curl command into an empty buffer:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
:r ! curl -s --url http://zcologia.com:8081/features/1
</pre>
<p >The -s option prevents capture of download rate stats. Use any feature URI that you find in <a class="reference" href="http://zcologia.com:8081/features">http://zcologia.com:8081/features</a>. The resulting JSON text will be a template for a new feature.</p>
<div class="image figure"><img alt="http://zcologia.com/images/got-template.jpg" class="figure" height="230" src="http://zcologia.com/images/got-template.jpg" width="670"></img></div>
<p >Edit the coordinates (this toy service is currently restricted to points), title, and summary. Any value you provide for id will be overridden, as will any timestamps.</p>
<div class="image figure"><img alt="http://zcologia.com/images/posting-data.jpg" class="figure" height="230" src="http://zcologia.com/images/posting-data.jpg" width="670"></img></div>
<p >Now, post this data to the <em >features</em> resource by piping the buffer contents back through curl:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
:% ! curl -s --url http://zcologia.com:8081/features -d @-
</pre>
<p >If you typed carefully, you'll get a result like:</p>
<div class="image figure"><img alt="http://zcologia.com/images/post-results.jpg" class="figure" height="230" src="http://zcologia.com/images/post-results.jpg" width="670"></img></div>
<p >Go ahead and browse to the resultant URL and admire the shiny new feature.</p>
<div class="image illus"><img alt="http://zcologia.com/images/map-after.jpg" class="illus" height="531" src="http://zcologia.com/images/map-after.jpg" width="418"></img></div>
<p >Reload the Google Maps page, and you'll see be able to see your new feature. If you're a careful typist, do play around with this as much as you want. I'll keep the service running as much as I can, though the features may come and go. If need be, I'll apply my blog comment policy to features posted by visitors and delete any obnoxious crap.</p>
<p >With luck, I'll add the capability to PUT and DELETE features next week.</p>
<p >I'll continue to tweak this toy and use it to explore Pleiades use cases: posting KML files created with Google Earth (would be nice to do it directly), and creating new features via GE and WebDAV are a few of the things we're looking at. Vim as a feature service client is fun for a while, but gets old quickly, and is a harrowing experiencing for a non-hacker. Still, the fact that you can use vim shows the enormous potential flexibility of this kind of system architecture.</p>

       <p >An older, slightly outdated, <a class="reference" href="http://zcologia.com/news/150/geometries-for-python/">post</a> of mine about Python geometry packages is getting read enough to warrant an update.</p>
<p >Geometries from mapscript.py and ogr.py haven't changed in the past year. The <a class="reference" href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/GeoDjango#GEOS">GeoDjango</a> developers are finding that the geometry API in geos.py isn't so bad -- perhaps because they're doing the bulk of their operations and transforms within the database -- but the fact remains that the GEOS project is trying to deprecate use of the C++ API, and that this puts geos.py in some peril.</p>
<p >Since the <a class="reference" href="http://trac.gispython.org/projects/PCL/wiki">Python Cartographic Library</a>'s 0.11 release, geometries are now a part of the PCL-Core component's cartography.geometry package. Howard Butler added pickle support, and we've fixed a number of bugs since the start of 2006. We've also reduced the dependencies of PCL-Core, as you can see in <a class="reference" href="http://trac.gispython.org/projects/PCL/browser/PCL/trunk/PCL-Core/INSTALL.txt">INSTALL.txt</a>. Remember, "zope" is now a namespace package, and you can install zope.interface [<a class="reference" href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/zope.interface/">Cheeseshop</a>] separately from any other piece of Zope 3.</p>
<p >I have nothing to report about <a class="reference" href="http://trac.osgeo.org/fdo/browser/trunk/Fdo/Python">FDO</a>'s brand new geometries for Python. My understanding is that they are also based on GEOS.</p>

<p >First and foremost, there's no public API for the spatial search, and no access other than via Google Earth or Maps (example <a class="reference" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=ancient+bridge+%2Bpleiades&sll=37.085858,29.707031&sspn=2.712319,3.999023&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=8&om=1&iwloc=A">here</a>). What's a geospatial developer to do? Navigate GMaps to a location, search, and then scrape the page for results? Ugh.</p>
<p >Next, there's very little information from Google about the steps geo-webmasters should take to be spatially indexed. One scant blog <a class="reference" href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/01/get-more-traffic-to-your-maps-api-site.html">post</a> about KML in sitemaps and a handful of <a class="reference" href="http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=2409">quotes</a> in Directions don't add up to much. I'd like to see some simple spatial tools integrated with Google's <a class="reference" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Webmaster Central</a>. Maybe this will be a part of Ed's new job?</p>
<p >I'm not going to trot out the famous Upton Sinclair quote here, but it can not be denied that geospatial search offerings from Google (and soon, I'm sure, from other search engines) are disruptive to the mainstream GIS industry. Many of us are catalog programmers or catalog salespersons, and there's a bit of ducking and covering going on. Hoping that the disruption goes away without altering the business isn't going to work. Over the next few years, the relevance of sites like the <a class="reference" href="http://gos2.geodata.gov/wps/portal/gos">Geospatial One-Stop</a>, or projects like OGC Web Catalog Service, will evaporate just like the relevance of Yahoo's web catalog did in the late 1990s.</p>
<p ><strong >Update</strong>: Paul Ramsey <a class="reference" href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/04/calgis-notes-day-1.html">reports</a> that the game-changing impact of spatial search was brought up in the CalGIS conference keynote.</p>

       <p ><strong >Update</strong> (2007-04-10): a related <a class="reference" href="http://zcologia.com/news/430/feature-demo">demo</a>.</p>
<p ><strong >Update</strong>: added examples of query results.</p>
<p >My <a class="reference" href="http://zcologia.com/news/406/ws-and-rest-again/">previous post</a> about WxS, RPC, and REST raised a few questions about whether
queries fit into a RESTful GIS. The answer is: yes, queries remain
indispensible. Indexes are a valuable part of your GIS, and a query API
provides web agents access to the indexes.</p>
<p >Consider a very minimal municipal GIS which tracks properties, or parcels. Each
parcel has many attributes, and the GIS indexes, at the very least, the
following: a unique parcel id, the name of the parcel's owner, and the
geospatial footprint of the parcel. These indexes allow a user to efficiently
find all properties owned by an individual, or find all properties potentially
impacted by construction along a particular path.</p>
<p >In a RESTful GIS, each parcel is a <em >resource</em>, and has a URL like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://example.org/parcels/[id]
</pre>
<p >Dereferencing the URL <a class="reference" href="http://example.org/parcels/1">http://example.org/parcels/1</a> returns a
<em >representation</em>, JSON in this case:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{ "id":       "1", 
  "owner":    "Homer Simpson",
  "geometry": {
    "type":        "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[...], ...] },
  ...
}
</pre>
<p >The "parcels" feature type is itself a resource. A useful representation of
this resource would be a collection that includes URIs for, and data about,
individual parcel resources -- all marshalled directly out of the GIS's
indexes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{ "parcels": [
  { "id": 1, "uri": "http://example.org/parcels/1",
    "owner": "Homer Simpson",
    "bbox": [1000.0, 1000.0, 1001.0, 1001.0] },
  { "id": 2, "uri": "http://example.org/parcels/2",
    "owner": "Ned Flanders",
    "bbox": [1001.0, 1001.0, 1002.0, 1002.0] },
  ...
  ]
}
</pre>
<p >That collection might easily include the precise footprints of properties,
but we'll simply consider bounding boxes here.</p>
<p >A query API should return criteria-based subsets of that collection, leveraging
the system's indexes. Which properties are going to be condemned to make way
for the new monorail?:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
GET /parcels/?bbox=0,0,2000,2000
</pre>
<p >The answer is: the parcels with URIs <a class="reference" href="http://example.org/parcels/42">http://example.org/parcels/42</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://example.org/parcels/83">http://example.org/parcels/83</a>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{ "parcels": [
  { "id": 42, "uri": "http://example.org/parcels/42",

<p >The specific query parameters or URL templates to use are an implementation
detail that I won't get into here (<a class="reference" href="http://opensearch.org">OpenSearch</a> seems promising).</p>

about feature resources along with a URI to the feature resources themselves in
the same way that a Google Search returns data from its index, with links,
instead of dumping the entire Web into your browser.</p>
