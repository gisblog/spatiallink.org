If the automated columns are specified precisely (rather than in a vague natural language), then the spec can be used to build code that implements them.  <br />
<br />
In this entry I'd like to propose an answer to the basic question, "What do those specs look like?"  What kind of automations can we support and how do we specify them?  This is not about implementation, triggers vs. views or what kind of views, but about specification, stating where the values come from and what they attach to.<br />
<br />
Consider the basic English statement that a customer may not exceed their credit limit.  If we translate this into a spec, we know we have two numbers, a credit limit, and some quantity I'll call "exposure" that is the customer's total balance.  It seems clear enough that we are saying the one cannot exceed the other, but where exactly did the "exposure" come from?<br />
<br />
I would suggest first that "exposure" is in fact a property of a customer, and so must be specified as a column in the customers table.  As far as the formula for "exposure", we will push the problem back by proposing a simple expression.  "exposure" = "orders_total" + "invoices_total".  This leaves us needing to define the "orders_total" and "invoices_total", which it should be clear are also properties of the customer table.  <br />
<br />
There is no mystery in defining "invoices_total" as SUM("orders.open"), taking for granted that the "open" amount of orders is itself determined by the status of the order ("invoices_total" follows the same basic idea).  This simple example actually reveals the shape of all non-trivial calculations, because it does two crucial things.  First it assumes a mechanism for copying values from table to table, and second, it reveals a scheme for building complex calculations through composition.  <br />
<br />
First lets look at composition.  If we want to convert complex program code to database specifications, we must not only be able to reduce the code to its most elemental formulas, but we must also rebuild that complexity using nothing but individual column definitions.  Clearly the first of two sine qua nons is to be able to express one calculated column in terms of another.<br />
<br />
The second sine qua non is the ability to specify a meaningful way to copy values from one table to another.  This turns out to be the foreign key.  In simple cases of one foreign key between two tables, we can specify a variety of operations.  At SDS we give the names "FETCH" and "DISTRIBUTE" to mechanisms for copying data from parent to child, and the familiar functions SUM, COUNT, MIN, etc. are used to aggregate data to parents.  There are others as well, but all of them are variations or modifications of these basic operations.<br />
<br />
So it turns out that if we want to be able to specify calculations that go beyond simple row extensions, all we have to do is follow the foreign key.  This should come as no surprise.  After all, if we specify a database with the correct keys, then the user's requests for calculated values and constraints ought to find easy expression by copying values from table to table along foreign keys and building complexity through composition.<br />

The first couple times I did this with a lower number of calls (1000 range) the numbers didnt seem so bad, but the ratio looked sketchy so I kicked it up a notch to get a better reproduction and sure enough, they start to look at lot like those reports on -hackers.  This makes more sense as the bug in question isn't something that should be able to be optimized away. <br />
<br />
So what does this mean?  I dunno... if you do a fair amount of testing to make sure your servers can handle the load you're going to be putting on them, I don't see much reason to avoid 8.2.3 (Again, our boxes are humming along fine).  Even if you think this will cause you a performance issue, testing your schema and application against any of the 8.2.x branch is a good way to spend time while you wait for 8.2.4 (the fix is in CVS now, so we should see a released fix soon), and in many cases resolving those types of fixes are generally more time consuming anyway.<br />";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 27 Mar 2007 16:53:00 +0000";s:7:"summary";s:4695:"I've been following reports of the 8.2.3 statistics bug for a few weeks now, mainly with intrest/concern as we run some 8.2.3 databases at <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/xzilla/exit.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbW5pdGkuY29tL2hvbWU=&amp;entry_id=293" title="http://www.omniti.com/home">OmniTI</a>.

I don't have answers per say, but I do have some information... I ran a few tests on our machines that run Solaris and PostgreSQL (compiled with Sun Studio, not GCC):<br />
<br />
<div><code>the test that <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/xzilla/exit.php?url=aHR0cDovL3Blb3BsZS5wbGFuZXRwb3N0Z3Jlc3FsLm9yZy9qb3NodWEv&amp;entry_id=293" title="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/joshua/">Joshua Drake</a> used:<br />

Of course, this is Solaris, so I poked <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/xzilla/exit.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZXRoYXJneS5vcmcvfmplc3VzLw==&amp;entry_id=293" title="http://www.lethargy.org/~jesus/">Theo</a> for some dtrace-fu, and (in the end) got the following results:<br />

The first couple times I did this with a lower number of calls (1000 range) the numbers didnt seem so bad, but the ratio looked sketchy so I kicked it up a notch to get a better reproduction and sure enough, they start to look at lot like those reports on -hackers.  This makes more sense as the bug in question isn't something that should be able to be optimized away. <br />
<br />
So what does this mean?  I dunno... if you do a fair amount of testing to make sure your servers can handle the load you're going to be putting on them, I don't see much reason to avoid 8.2.3 (Again, our boxes are humming along fine).  Even if you think this will cause you a performance issue, testing your schema and application against any of the 8.2.x branch is a good way to spend time while you wait for 8.2.4 (the fix is in CVS now, so we should see a released fix soon), and in many cases resolving those types of fixes are generally more time consuming anyway.<br />";}i:20;a:6:{s:5:"title";s:73:"Devrim Gündüz: 8.2.3 RPMs for RHEL 5 released + some other package news";s:4:"guid";s:74:"http://people.planetpostgresql.org/devrim/index.php?/archives/90-guid.html";s:4:"link";s:126:"http://people.planetpostgresql.org/devrim/index.php?/archives/90-8.2.3-RPMs-for-RHEL-5-released-+-some-other-package-news.html";s:11:"description";s:716:"<br />
