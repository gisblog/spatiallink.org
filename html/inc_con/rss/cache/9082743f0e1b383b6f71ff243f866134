<p>Although at first blush it sounds nice to bring this work into an existing service, I agree with the opinions that it should stay separate.

<p>1. keep WFS Simple focussed on being the generic geospatial data query language for mainstream web data formats like Atom+GeoRSS, KML, etc.</p>
<p>2. Componentize the design of the service, so that this is not really one service, but a simple, clear way to design services focussed on a particular data type like Atom+GeoRSS by adding or removing a parameter or two.</p>

<p>So, on to the purpose of this post. Sean Gillies started an <a target="_blank" title="Forget Mass Market, it's All About the Web." href="http://zcologia.com/news/328">interesting thread</a> in response to Ed Parsons&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=392">report</a> from this week&#8217;s OGC meetings. He basically says OGC&#8217;s current W*S service stack will not geo-enable the Web.</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m here to say OGC agrees. Yes, the current services are targeted squarely at the mainstream geospatial community. That&#8217;s a good thing, and there is a huge community of professionals who need that level of detail, functionality, and therefore complexity. But there&#8217;s a much larger Web community out there that we are not serving.</p>
<p>The intent of the mass market working group is to go in to this with no preconceptions. Study the consumer, &#8220;hacker&#8221;, and even the mainstream corporate IT communities and architect a geo strategy for those markets. That strategy may or may not align perfectly with what OGC has developed in the past, and if it doesn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s OK. There seems to be general consensus that every standard doesn&#8217;t have to fit nicely together on the drawing board. Adoption, or as John Herring said, &#8220;ubiquity&#8221;, should be the primary goal. (I had better note here that this is my personal opinion, not OGC&#8217;s, etc.)</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll end by saying the future is wide open. OGC members are generally excited by this new direction&#8211;the support for starting the group was overwhelming. The problem is that most of them have traditional geospatial jobs and problems to solve, so the mass market requirements aren&#8217;t going to come, without larger participation.</p>
<p>And finally a note about the name, Mass Market. I&#8217;m not in love with the name either. Don&#8217;t hire me to name your next product. But what if we had called it the geoweb working group? Would I be getting flamed like Google did over that new geoweb layer in Earth? ;)</p>
