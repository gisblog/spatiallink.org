<p>
As far as evolution is concerned, there’s a cadre of strict Darwinists who will push back against any encroachment into their field, but neo-Darwinism, which tries to address glaring gaps in Darwin’s original theory (after all, he knew nothing of DNA, genes, and the chemical basis of mutations) is a respected field, too. I often think that my interest in genetics, which has led to a book being published this fall, arouses vehement objections because scientists want to protect their turf, and seeing an interested amateur write about troubling issues they haven’t resolved causes them to cry, “How dare he?”
</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it just adorable how he veers wildly from describing himself as an <q>interested amateur</q>, begging to be cut a little slack, and puffing himself up as a co-worker to <q>high-level scientists</q>? Pick a position and stick with it.</p>
<p>But really, this isn&#8217;t a question of established scientists being affronted by a clever upstart &#8212; it&#8217;s about someone who knows nothing about evolutionary theory pretentiously telling competent people what they are supposed to do. He&#8217;s <em>Choprasplaining</em>, and it gets old fast.</p>
<p>To demonstrate that he&#8217;s an ignoramus, he gives us a list of Major Problems in evolutionary theory. Would you be surprised if I told you that none of them are problems for evolution at all?</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Here are some of the problematic issues that evolutionary theory currently grapples with.</p>
<p>1. No one knows the biological basis of mind; therefore, linking the physical nature of the brain with actual thinking is totally unproven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, since most of the products of evolution do not have a brain and are completely mindless, I think we can safely say you can study evolution quite well without ever having to contemplate consciousness at all.</p>
<p>We also do not have to have a complete understanding of how minds work to recognize its biological basis. I know my television uses electricity to work because if I unplug it from the wall, it stops working; similarly, I know my my mind is the product of biology because if I physically damage my brain, or change its chemistry, my mind gets scrambled. It&#8217;s entirely clear that there is a strong physical component to the mind, and it&#8217;s quite likely that it is entirely natural and mechanistic.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>2. Applying Darwinian principles to the meteoric rise of Homo sapiens confronts the bald fact that as a species we have leapt ahead far faster than random mutations can account for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is simply false. We have compared the genomic sequence of humans and chimpanzees, for instance, and the number of nucleotide changes since our divergence is entirely within the bounds of normal rates of genetic change. He&#8217;s just making stuff up.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>3. Without understanding consciousness, one cannot understand human beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Chopra understand consciousness? I rather doubt it; I get the impression he uses &#8220;consciousness&#8221; as a buzzword, in the same way he uses &#8220;quantum&#8221;. He doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about, but gosh, it sure sounds <em>profound</em>…until you realize that he&#8217;s just babbling fatuously.</p>
<p>We could also ask…did Shakespeare understand consciousness? How about Sappho and Basho? How about Homer and Shelley? Yet I would argue that not understanding the biochemistry and electrical activity of the brain did not seem to impair their understanding of human beings.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>4. Because we are self-aware, human beings construct societies and thought structures that impact our evolution far more than natural selection, which is based on securing an advantage in two areas: securing food and gaining mating rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s more to evolution than natural selection, and most biologists would agree that genetic change is driven more by chance than selection. Darwin himself thought it extremely important that individuals make choices &#8212; look up sexual selection &#8212; and that construction of an environment that modifies the effects of selection is not just a human trait. Quorum sensing in bacteria, for instance, is an example of non-human creatures modifying their environment to have an effect on the propagation of their genes.</p>
<p>And that is the most peculiarly narrow definition of selection that I&#8217;ve ever read. Here&#8217;s Futuyma&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important to recognize that “natural selection” is not synonymous with “evolution.” Evolution can occur by processes other than natural selection, especially genetic drift. And natural selection can occur without any evolutionary change, as when natural selection maintains the status quo by eliminating deviants from the optimal phenotype.</p>
<p>
Many definitions of natural selection have been proposed (Endler 1986). For our purposes, we will define natural selection as any consistent difference in fitness among phenotypically different classes of biological entities.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viruses evolve. It&#8217;s hard to whittle their existence down to &#8220;food&#8221; and &#8220;mating rights&#8221; &#8212; a lot of evolving organisms don&#8217;t even bother with that mating and sexual reproduction business.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>5. Human evolution long ago escaped the physical pressures that other species are entirely bound by—the discovery of fire was just a link in a chain of advances that set prehistoric man on the road to self-sufficiency, eventually leading to the fantastic notion, now at the very heart of science, that humanity can conquer Nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there were one simple misconception that I could eradicate from the public mind, that one&#8217;s near the top of my list. We have not escaped from evolutionary processes <em>at all</em>. Even an ignoramus who thinks that selection only involves food and mating rights ought to be able to recognize that people still starve and people still fail to reproduce and children still die of diseases.</p>
<p>I concede that there probably were scientists who thought they could conquer nature &#8212; most of them villains in bad novels &#8212; but it&#8217;s not exactly a popular idea at all in scientific circles nowadays. It&#8217;s certainly not at the <q>heart of science</q>. Especially given that the major trend of scientific discoveries over the past few centuries has been to dethrone humanity from its egotistical view of itself as the Pinnacle of Creation and Center of the Universe.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>6. In order to settle any of the preceding issues, evolutionary theorists are at an enormous disadvantage. They can’t do experiments to validate what they believe happened in the distant past, and when it comes down to certain fundamental beliefs, such as random mutations, their experimentation is largely confined to micro-organisms and primitive species like the fruit fly, conducted within the tiny, sterile confines of the laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh. Fuck you too, Deepak Chopra.</p>
<p>We can do experiments to figure out what happened in the past. There are all kinds of cool experiments done, inferring ancestral states of molecules, and then making genetic constructs to test their properties. We look at a phenomenon like limb evolution, for example, and then ask what developmental processes drive digit identity and formation.</p>
<p>Mutations occur in humans, too &#8212; we&#8217;ve measured the rate. They are random, as well.</p>
<p>I experiment on fish. Others do too; there have been remarkable strides made in understanding the evolution of variations in sticklebacks (that&#8217;s variation in the wild, not the lab). There are a huge number of experiments done on our fellow mammal, the mouse.</p>
<p>There are institutes of human genetics in Utah, California, Iowa, Germany, India, Japan, China…everywhere. What does Chopra think they do there?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just going to have to piss on the anti-scientific stupidity of calling <i>Drosophila</i> a <q>primitive species</q>. Fruit flies are highly derived, intricate products of evolution. We are learning a great deal studying them.</p>
<p>How much do we learn studying Chopra&#8217;s bizarre New Age ideology? It&#8217;s clear that he is an evolution-denier, since he wants to replace well-grounded, evidence based concepts with wacky amorphous blather about &#8220;consciousness&#8221;, and doesn&#8217;t know the first thing about evolution itself.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that gorgeous? It&#8217;s a pre-WWII racing plane that got shelved by the war and never flew. There&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBugatti100pProject">project in the works to reconstruct one</a>, but as far as I know, it hasn&#8217;t got off the ground yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, check your garages. If you&#8217;ve got a Bugatti 100 moldering in there, let me know, and I&#8217;ll take it off your hands. I don&#8217;t have a million dollars, but I might be able to (checks bank account, pats pockets, looks under sofa cushions) cough up a few hundred dollars, easy.</p>
<p>Wait, part of that will have to go to learning how to fly. So some money, anyway.</p>

They sort of illustrate the arrangement of the tissues involved, but of course they all have shortcomings…but then explaining how the metaphor doesn&#8217;t work can be just as informative as the metaphor itself.</p>
<p>For instance, early in its development, the vertebrate embryo consists of two epithelial sheets, the epiblast and hypoblast, pressed against each other like two slices of bread. That&#8217;s easy to visualize. It also allows me to explain the core idea of an epithelium &#8212; a layer of cells tightly linked to one another to form a continuous more or less two dimensional sheet. A lot of animal development is about epithelia folding and contacting other layers. But another important concept is that some cells are <em>not</em> in sheets &#8212; they&#8217;ve dissociated and are moving in a loose mass surrounded by an extracellular matrix. This is called mesenchyme. Mesenchyme would be the gooey jelly between the two sheet-like bread slices.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s where the metaphor falls down: this jelly sandwich is made by a portion of the bread slices folding inward &#8212; invaginating &#8212; or falling apart &#8212; delaminating &#8212; and migrating into the space between the bread slices. This is clearly not how we make jelly sandwiches. But even that weird difference is important and illuminating. In addition to coherent sheets forming tissues and organs, another hallmark of animal development is the disassembly of sheets into masses of migrating cells. This process is called the EMT, or epithelial-mesenchyme transition, and it&#8217;s not just important during development, but is also invoked again by cancers when they metastasize.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another deviation from standard human kitchen practices: after the jelly has formed, part of the bread is rolling up into a tube to form the nervous system (the burrito!), and simultaneously, that jelly is organizing itself into a series of balls &#8212; it&#8217;s also making a meatball sub.

<p><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2015/07/meatball-sub.png"><img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2015/07/meatball-sub-500x500.png" alt="meatball sub" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17130" /></a></p>
<p>But this is another of the extremely cool processes that is going on during the pharyngula stage of development. First we have cells undergoing EMT and leaving their epithelium of origin, migrating into the interior of the embryo, and then a significant subset of these mesenchymal cells clump together to form these ball-like masses called somites that are organized in an orderly row down the length of the animal. Somites are relatively undifferentiated  balls of mesoderm. Let me emphasize that: they are not muscle, or bone, or connective tissue, common mesodermal derivatives, at least not yet. They are blobs of condensing mesenchyme.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the next series of steps where they begin to depart from my metaphor even further. The somite begins to differentiate regionally &#8212; parts of it are going to follow new paths of development. First, a portion of the myotome ventrally and medially begins to fall apart and stream towards the central notochord. This part is called the sclerotome, and the part it leaves behind is the dermomyotome. The sclerotome is going to differentiate into bone, particularly the vertebrae that surround the notochord and spinal cord. So eat your meatball sub fast, before a quadrant of the meatballs turns to bone!</p>
<p><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2015/07/myotomediv.jpg"><img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2015/07/myotomediv-500x146.jpg" alt="myotomediv" width="500" height="146" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17131" /></a></p>
<p>The formation of the sclerotome, by the way, is an example of induction: signals from the notochord tell nearby cells of the myotome that their fate is to become bone. We can do experiments in which additional pieces of notochord are transplanted near the myotome, and they will recruit more cells to become sclerotome.</p>
<p>The dermomyotome is going to divide as well to form a tissue called the dermatome, which will contribute to the connective tissue of the skin, for instance, and another part called the myotome which will form the muscles proper.  The myotome is just the start of a long series of developmental decisions that will transform an undifferentiated mass into the complex collection of varied cell types that will make up the trunk and tail of an animal, and that will get drawn out and shaped to form the limbs of tetrapods.</p>
<p>You might be thinking somites are amazingly cool, but if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re also wondering where they came from &#8212; can we say much about the evolution of this pattern of organization? And the answer is, only a little. This way of building a body is deeply primitive to all chordates, so all extant species are doing something very similar.</p>
<p>The tunicates are an exception. Tunicates have definitely gone their own way &#8212; they&#8217;ve thrown away segmentation, for instance, and just make a continuous mass of contractile cells along the length of the tadpole larva. They&#8217;ve also dismantled the regulatory linkages between their Hox genes, and those genes are no longer in a tidy colinear sequence in the genome.  So they&#8217;re interesting in a unique way, but they are highly derived and do not reflect the ancestral condition.</p>
<p>Amphioxus, on the other hand, is phylogenetically more distant from us than are the tunicates, but does form somites &#8212; which tells us that the ancient pre-Cambrian worm, our common ancestor, almost certainly built themselves from the meatball sub recipe. But Amphioxus and vertebrates also exhibit some interesting differences.</p>
<p>For one, Amphioxus doesn&#8217;t make myotomes by balling up a loose mesenchyme; instead, it&#8217;s <em>all</em> epithelial. They form from an evagination of other epithelia, and retain their epithelial character &#8212; so they aren&#8217;t jelly-like at all, but are sheets formed by folding in another sheet. Some cells do delaminate and contribute to connective tissue, though, so they are capable of EMT, they just do it to a much more limited degree than seen in vertebrates.</p>
<p>Another question: Amphioxus does not have a bony skeleton; that bone thing is an innovation by early vertebrates. Much of the vertebrate skeleton (but not all!) is formed by sclerotomes; do Amphioxus myotomes have a homolog to the vertebrate sclerotome? Unsurprisingly, they do, and rather than being a mesenchyme, it is once again an epithelium that extends and wraps around the myotome.</p>

<p>The relationships of all the tissues are the same in vertebrates and protochordates, which tells us the last common ancestor of all chordates almost certainly had segmentally organized myotomes, and a layer of cells set aside to form sclerotomes, even in protochordates lacking a bony skeleton, and that this layer would later be coopted for building bony vertebrae.

They sort of illustrate the arrangement of the tissues involved, but of course they all have shortcomings…but then explaining how the metaphor doesn&#8217;t work can be just as informative as the metaphor itself.</p>
<p>For instance, early in its development, the vertebrate embryo consists of two epithelial sheets, the epiblast and hypoblast, pressed against each other like two slices of bread. That&#8217;s easy to visualize. It also allows me to explain the core idea of an epithelium &#8212; a layer of cells tightly linked to one another to form a continuous more or less two dimensional sheet. A lot of animal development is about epithelia folding and contacting other layers. But another important concept is that some cells are <em>not</em> in sheets &#8212; they&#8217;ve dissociated and are moving in a loose mass surrounded by an extracellular matrix. This is called mesenchyme. Mesenchyme would be the gooey jelly between the two sheet-like bread slices.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s where the metaphor falls down: this jelly sandwich is made by a portion of the bread slices folding inward &#8212; invaginating &#8212; or falling apart &#8212; delaminating &#8212; and migrating into the space between the bread slices. This is clearly not how we make jelly sandwiches. But even that weird difference is important and illuminating. In addition to coherent sheets forming tissues and organs, another hallmark of animal development is the disassembly of sheets into masses of migrating cells. This process is called the EMT, or epithelial-mesenchyme transition, and it&#8217;s not just important during development, but is also invoked again by cancers when they metastasize.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another deviation from standard human kitchen practices: after the jelly has formed, part of the bread is rolling up into a tube to form the nervous system (the burrito!), and simultaneously, that jelly is organizing itself into a series of balls &#8212; it&#8217;s also making a meatball sub. If you are finding this concurrent mix of odd sandwiches unappetizing, that&#8217;s OK &#8212; don&#8217;t eat any embryos, then.</p>
