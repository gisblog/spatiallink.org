And, when it comes to things like patents, the Supreme Court decided that Congress could not pass a law that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-531.ZS.html" target="_blank">takes away such sovereign immunity</a> from the states. <br /><br /> In practice, this means state governments -- including things like research universities -- are able to infringe on patents in the public interest, claiming sovereign immunity in state courts against such claims. We've pointed out in the past how hypocritical it is that state universities frequently use such sovereign immunity claims to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071113/173911.shtml">avoid lawsuits</a>, while at the same time being some of the most aggressive patent trolls in going after others (with the University of California being a prime example). However, it is the law of the land and in the Constitution that sovereign immunity on things like patents <b>cannot</b> be abridged. <br /><br /> Yet, as the video above notes, the TPP appears to get rid of that, and would open up states, at the very least, to these international corporate sovereignty tribunals (also known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS, tribunals). <br /><br /> In other words, the USTR may single-handedly undermine the Constitution's 11th Amendment, overturning Supreme Court precedent on the subject in a deal negotiated entirely in secret, with patent holders (who hate the sovereign immunity protections) as the key advisors. That's not how our government is supposed to work. <br /><br /> The threat here isn't just theoretical. Beyond the various patent cases that universities and state governments have been able to toss out via sovereign immunity, the video mentions the infamous lawsuit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141017/14481728861/appeals-court-overturns-important-fair-use-win-concerning-university-e-reserves-potentially-good-reasons.shtml">against Georgia State University</a> over its e-reserves program. While that case has focused on the fair use questions involved, it's entirely possible that Georgia State could also claim sovereign immunity. And since the plaintiffs suing Georgia State are "foreign" publishers (including Oxford University Press and Cambridge Press), under the ISDS system, rather than going to a US court that would recognize sovereign immunity, they could just go to an ISDS tribunal which wouldn't care about sovereign immunity. <br /><br /> Do we really want the USTR completely wiping out part of our Constitution (which has helped enable university research) via a secretive trade agreement with no public accountability?<br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/23003431797/contrary-to-what-youve-heard-tpp-will-undermine-us-law-including-supreme-court-decisions.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/23003431797/contrary-to-what-youve-heard-tpp-will-undermine-us-law-including-supreme-court-decisions.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/23003431797/contrary-to-what-youve-heard-tpp-will-undermine-us-law-including-supreme-court-decisions.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48987b6d/sc/24/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

Beyond the various patent cases that universities and state governments have been able to toss out via sovereign immunity, the video mentions the infamous lawsuit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141017/14481728861/appeals-court-overturns-important-fair-use-win-concerning-university-e-reserves-potentially-good-reasons.shtml">against Georgia State University</a> over its e-reserves program. While that case has focused on the fair use questions involved, it's entirely possible that Georgia State could also claim sovereign immunity. And since the plaintiffs suing Georgia State are "foreign" publishers (including Oxford University Press and Cambridge Press), under the ISDS system, rather than going to a US court that would recognize sovereign immunity, they could just go to an ISDS tribunal which wouldn't care about sovereign immunity. <br /><br /> Do we really want the USTR completely wiping out part of our Constitution (which has helped enable university research) via a secretive trade agreement with no public accountability?<br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/23003431797/contrary-to-what-youve-heard-tpp-will-undermine-us-law-including-supreme-court-decisions.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/23003431797/contrary-to-what-youve-heard-tpp-will-undermine-us-law-including-supreme-court-decisions.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/23003431797/contrary-to-what-youve-heard-tpp-will-undermine-us-law-including-supreme-court-decisions.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566401585/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48987b6d/sc/24/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48987b6d/sc/24/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

Some proposals include a colony; most don't. It's obvious that animals have evolved to live on Earth and <b>not</b> in space, and it will take quite a bit of adjustment to get comfortable in a space colony of any kind -- whether it exists on the moon or Mars or just floats around somewhere in between. In any case, if we're serious about visiting other planets, we'll need to figure out how to survive the journey (and pay for it). Here are just a few links on the topic of colonizing space, even though no one has a complete plan for how to do so. <ul> <li> <a title="http://www.popsci.com/colonizing-moon-may-be-90-percent-cheaper-we-thought?" href="http://bit.ly/1LOsXXW">A NASA-commissioned study estimates that a mission to colonize the moon might be 90% cheaper than previously thought.</a> Instead of $100 billion, a $10 billion price tag for a moon colony sounds like a great deal, but it would depend on several factors: partnerships with private companies and international space agencies, re-usable rocket technology, as well as the presence of lunar resources such as water and/or hydrogen in the lunar crust.

If it was, hundreds of journalists would be in jail. The law cited by the union only prevents <i>law enforcement officers</i> from stealing or disseminating this information. On top of that, while the lawsuit alleged the documents were stolen, no evidence was provided to back up this claim. <br /><br /> This attempt to prevent information of public interest from reaching the public was greeted with an anti-SLAPP motion from the LA Times. This was sustained by the lower court, which found the plaintiffs' arguments severely deficient. <blockquote> <i>The court noted the Doe declarations ALADS submitted &#8220;contain no personal details about the declarants that would relieve them of the obligation of identifying themselves, particularly when the declarations contain the hearsay statement of defendant Faturechi concerning when the article is going to be published and what it will contain -- the evidence most critical to the showing of irreparable harm or immediate danger that plaintiff must make to justify ex parte relief.&#8221; The court also observed, &#8220;The declarations are also very vague in their reference to the personal information that Faturechi told the declarants he would be publishing.&#8221; The court &#8220;decline[d] to issue a TRO imposing a prior restraint on defendants&#8217; free speech based on the speculative hearsay testimony of anonymous witnesses.&#8221;</i> <br /><br /> <i>The court denied the application on the additional ground that ALADS -- by its own admission -- had known for weeks if not months that the Times had information from the OPS/LASD deputies&#8217; files, that notwithstanding this knowledge it had not proceeded by noticed motion, and therefore that &#8220;any exigency appear[ed] to be of [ALADS&#8217;] own making . . . . &#8221;</i> </blockquote> This, of course, led to an appeal. <br /><br /> The appeal, even if successful, would have been a lost cause. By the time it reached the California appeals court, the information had already been published. Once prior restraint was denied, the only thing left for the plaintiffs to do was find some way to punish the paper for its act of journalism. <br /><br /> The appeals court is <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2178874/cop-slapp.pdf" target="_blank">similarly unmoved</a> by the plaintiffs' post-publication arguments, which are pretty much mostly a repetition of its previous failed arguments, with the addition of the assertion that the LA Times shouldn't have been able to invoke anti-SLAPP laws because it was trafficking in "stolen" material. Again, the appeals court agrees with the finding of the lower court -- that the plaintiffs make a lot of accusations, but can't seem to be able to back them up. <blockquote> <i>ALADS asserts the trial court erred in finding the Times had met its burden on the first step of the analysis because the Times obtained the LASD files &#8220;through criminal means.&#8221; ALADS repeats the allegation from its complaint that the Times reporter &#8220;stole, received from someone else who stole, or otherwise unlawfully came into physical possession of the confidential background investigation files...&#8221; As the trial court correctly observed, ALADS has presented no admissible evidence that Faturechi or anyone else at the Times stole anything.</i> </blockquote> And even if the documents were indeed stolen, the LASD officers and police union can't seem to find anything that indicates a law was broken by the LA Times' publication of the material. <blockquote> <i>ALADS cites -- and miscites -- various statutes it contends are violated by Faturechi&#8217;s mere possession of the records. For example, ALADS asserts that section 6200 of the Government Code makes it a crime for &#8220;any person&#8221; to steal, remove, or secrete &#8220;official government documents.&#8221; But the statute does not say &#8220;any person.&#8221; It says &#8220;[e]very officer&#8221; who has custody of a record &#8220;deposited in any public office&#8221; shall not steal, remove, secrete, destroy, mutilate, deface, alter, or falsify the record or permit another person to do so. The section is entitled &#8220;Custodial officers; theft, destruction, alteration, falsification.&#8221; Similarly, ALADS claims Government Code section 3307.5 &#8220;makes it illegal, as a matter of law, for anyone&#8221; to release a photograph of a peace officer to the public. In fact, that statute concerns officers&#8217; relationships with the agencies that employ them. It says officers shall not be &#8220;required as a condition of employment&#8221; to consent to the use of their photographs on the Internet.</i> </blockquote> The court also addresses the "privacy violation" arguments advanced by the police union and the anonymous Doe plaintiffs, finding them similarly weak. <blockquote> <i>The first problem with ALADS&#8217; argument is that any privacy right in the information contained in deputies&#8217; employment applications belongs to the deputies (and their employer, LASD), not to the deputies&#8217; labor union. &#8220;It is well settled that the right of privacy is purely a personal one; it cannot be asserted by anyone other than the person whose privacy has been invaded, that is, plaintiff must plead and prove that his privacy has been invaded.&#8221;</i> </blockquote> Finally, the court takes on the union's claim that its attempted prior restraint wasn't really prior restraint. <blockquote> <i>[T]he injunction ALADS seeks would not be &#8220;content-neutral&#8221; at all. ALADS asks the court to enjoin the Times from publishing any article containing any information in 16 listed categories, including the names of any OPS/LASD deputies, their photographs, and their &#8220;non-public criminal history.&#8221;</i> <br /><br /> <i>In sum, ALADS has cited no case permitting the kind of injunction it seeks here, to restrain a newspaper from publishing news articles on a matter of public concern: the qualifications of applicants for jobs as law enforcement officers. <b>ALADS has cited no case because there is no such case. For more than one hundred years, federal and state courts have refused to allow the subjects of potential news reports to stop journalists from publishing reports about them.</b></i> </blockquote> Which is all this actually is. The police union and the Doe officers, too concerned about their reputations to put their name on the lawsuit, wanted nothing more than to bury unflattering information. Neither the union nor the officers seemed to have any problem with former officers fired for misconduct or illegal behavior being allowed back into positions of authority and power, but they had a serious problem with the LA Times letting the public in on its dirty secrets. Fortunately, two consecutive courts refused to buy the plaintiffs' censorious, malformed arguments. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150724/00150231746/court-shuts-down-police-unions-attempt-to-bury-reporting-sheriffs-depts-hiring-bad-cops-thieves-sex-offenders.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150724/00150231746/court-shuts-down-police-unions-attempt-to-bury-reporting-sheriffs-depts-hiring-bad-cops-thieves-sex-offenders.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150724/00150231746/court-shuts-down-police-unions-attempt-to-bury-reporting-sheriffs-depts-hiring-bad-cops-thieves-sex-offenders.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48946462/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

This was sustained by the lower court, which found the plaintiffs' arguments severely deficient. <blockquote> <i>The court noted the Doe declarations ALADS submitted &#8220;contain no personal details about the declarants that would relieve them of the obligation of identifying themselves, particularly when the declarations contain the hearsay statement of defendant Faturechi concerning when the article is going to be published and what it will contain -- the evidence most critical to the showing of irreparable harm or immediate danger that plaintiff must make to justify ex parte relief.&#8221; The court also observed, &#8220;The declarations are also very vague in their reference to the personal information that Faturechi told the declarants he would be publishing.&#8221; The court &#8220;decline[d] to issue a TRO imposing a prior restraint on defendants&#8217; free speech based on the speculative hearsay testimony of anonymous witnesses.&#8221;</i> <br /><br /> <i>The court denied the application on the additional ground that ALADS -- by its own admission -- had known for weeks if not months that the Times had information from the OPS/LASD deputies&#8217; files, that notwithstanding this knowledge it had not proceeded by noticed motion, and therefore that &#8220;any exigency appear[ed] to be of [ALADS&#8217;] own making . . . . &#8221;</i> </blockquote> This, of course, led to an appeal. <br /><br /> The appeal, even if successful, would have been a lost cause. By the time it reached the California appeals court, the information had already been published. Once prior restraint was denied, the only thing left for the plaintiffs to do was find some way to punish the paper for its act of journalism. <br /><br /> The appeals court is <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2178874/cop-slapp.pdf" target="_blank">similarly unmoved</a> by the plaintiffs' post-publication arguments, which are pretty much mostly a repetition of its previous failed arguments, with the addition of the assertion that the LA Times shouldn't have been able to invoke anti-SLAPP laws because it was trafficking in "stolen" material. Again, the appeals court agrees with the finding of the lower court -- that the plaintiffs make a lot of accusations, but can't seem to be able to back them up. <blockquote> <i>ALADS asserts the trial court erred in finding the Times had met its burden on the first step of the analysis because the Times obtained the LASD files &#8220;through criminal means.&#8221; ALADS repeats the allegation from its complaint that the Times reporter &#8220;stole, received from someone else who stole, or otherwise unlawfully came into physical possession of the confidential background investigation files...&#8221; As the trial court correctly observed, ALADS has presented no admissible evidence that Faturechi or anyone else at the Times stole anything.</i> </blockquote> And even if the documents were indeed stolen, the LASD officers and police union can't seem to find anything that indicates a law was broken by the LA Times' publication of the material. <blockquote> <i>ALADS cites -- and miscites -- various statutes it contends are violated by Faturechi&#8217;s mere possession of the records. For example, ALADS asserts that section 6200 of the Government Code makes it a crime for &#8220;any person&#8221; to steal, remove, or secrete &#8220;official government documents.&#8221; But the statute does not say &#8220;any person.&#8221; It says &#8220;[e]very officer&#8221; who has custody of a record &#8220;deposited in any public office&#8221; shall not steal, remove, secrete, destroy, mutilate, deface, alter, or falsify the record or permit another person to do so. The section is entitled &#8220;Custodial officers; theft, destruction, alteration, falsification.&#8221; Similarly, ALADS claims Government Code section 3307.5 &#8220;makes it illegal, as a matter of law, for anyone&#8221; to release a photograph of a peace officer to the public. In fact, that statute concerns officers&#8217; relationships with the agencies that employ them. It says officers shall not be &#8220;required as a condition of employment&#8221; to consent to the use of their photographs on the Internet.</i> </blockquote> The court also addresses the "privacy violation" arguments advanced by the police union and the anonymous Doe plaintiffs, finding them similarly weak. <blockquote> <i>The first problem with ALADS&#8217; argument is that any privacy right in the information contained in deputies&#8217; employment applications belongs to the deputies (and their employer, LASD), not to the deputies&#8217; labor union. &#8220;It is well settled that the right of privacy is purely a personal one; it cannot be asserted by anyone other than the person whose privacy has been invaded, that is, plaintiff must plead and prove that his privacy has been invaded.&#8221;</i> </blockquote> Finally, the court takes on the union's claim that its attempted prior restraint wasn't really prior restraint. <blockquote> <i>[T]he injunction ALADS seeks would not be &#8220;content-neutral&#8221; at all. ALADS asks the court to enjoin the Times from publishing any article containing any information in 16 listed categories, including the names of any OPS/LASD deputies, their photographs, and their &#8220;non-public criminal history.&#8221;</i> <br /><br /> <i>In sum, ALADS has cited no case permitting the kind of injunction it seeks here, to restrain a newspaper from publishing news articles on a matter of public concern: the qualifications of applicants for jobs as law enforcement officers. <b>ALADS has cited no case because there is no such case. For more than one hundred years, federal and state courts have refused to allow the subjects of potential news reports to stop journalists from publishing reports about them.</b></i> </blockquote> Which is all this actually is. The police union and the Doe officers, too concerned about their reputations to put their name on the lawsuit, wanted nothing more than to bury unflattering information. Neither the union nor the officers seemed to have any problem with former officers fired for misconduct or illegal behavior being allowed back into positions of authority and power, but they had a serious problem with the LA Times letting the public in on its dirty secrets. Fortunately, two consecutive courts refused to buy the plaintiffs' censorious, malformed arguments. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150724/00150231746/court-shuts-down-police-unions-attempt-to-bury-reporting-sheriffs-depts-hiring-bad-cops-thieves-sex-offenders.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150724/00150231746/court-shuts-down-police-unions-attempt-to-bury-reporting-sheriffs-depts-hiring-bad-cops-thieves-sex-offenders.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150724/00150231746/court-shuts-down-police-unions-attempt-to-bury-reporting-sheriffs-depts-hiring-bad-cops-thieves-sex-offenders.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566423853/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48946462/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48946462/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

While the state of the law isn't perfectly clear, there's a colorable argument <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/507/case.html" target="_blank">that threatened breach of a nondisclosure agreement may be a basis for prior restraint if the underlying confidentiality interest is strong enough.</a> It's not a bulletproof argument, but it's much better than ignoring the prior restraint issue entirely. </p> <p> In sum: if the court based the prior restraint on a violation of California's secret-recording law, I think it probably violates the First Amendment.

But the order <em>might</em> be sustainable because CMP engaged in the dubious practice of signing a pledge of confidentiality with the intent of breaking it. </p> </i></blockquote> Of course, Popehat also notes that if the group already gave the video to someone else -- such as a journalist -- the court can't block that group from releasing it, as that is definitely prior restraint. <br /><br /> In short, chances are that this video is going to get out no matter what eventually -- and to some extent, this lawsuit and request for a restraining order is only likely to <i>draw more attention</i> to the whole thing in the first place (and the fact that StemExpress doesn't want it to come out).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/17111931794/judge-bars-anti-abortion-group-releasing-video-raising-serious-first-amendment-questions.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/17111931794/judge-bars-anti-abortion-group-releasing-video-raising-serious-first-amendment-questions.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/17111931794/judge-bars-anti-abortion-group-releasing-video-raising-serious-first-amendment-questions.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566367028/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/489432c7/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/489432c7/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

As you hopefully already know, last year, a European court came out with a troubling ruling that required Google into a sort of "right to be forgotten" situation, where links associated with someone's name that were magically deemed no longer relevant, needed to be "de-linked." Google reluctantly complied, and has since been busy de-linking many individuals from totally factual news stories about them. But, given that this was the law in Europe, it only did so in Europe. <br /><br /> That resulted in the complaint from France -- to which Google has now responded by saying <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2015/07/implementing-european-not-global-right.html" target="_blank">it <b>will not</b> comply with a global right to be forgotten</a>, because the results would be catastrophic for free speech and the open internet: <blockquote><i> This is a troubling development that risks serious chilling effects on the web. <br /><br /> While the right to be forgotten may now be the law in Europe, it is not the law globally. Moreover, there are innumerable examples around the world where content that is declared illegal under the laws of one country, would be deemed legal in others: Thailand criminalizes some speech that is critical of its King, Turkey criminalizes some speech that is critical of Ataturk, and Russia outlaws some speech that is deemed to be “gay propaganda." <br /><br /> If the [French regulator's] proposed approach were to be embraced as the standard for Internet regulation, we would find ourselves in a race to the bottom. <b>In the end, the Internet would only be as free as the world’s least free place.</b> <br /><br /> We believe that no one country should have the authority to to control what content someone in a second country can access. We also believe this order is disproportionate and unnecessary, given that the overwhelming majority of French internet users—currently around 97%—access a European version of Google’s search engine like google.fr, rather than Google.com or any other version of Google. </i></blockquote> I can't see into the future, but I'll take a wild guess and suggest that the French regulators aren't going to just back down following this response, no matter how reasonable and rational it is.

As you hopefully already know, last year, a European court came out with a troubling ruling that required Google into a sort of "right to be forgotten" situation, where links associated with someone's name that were magically deemed no longer relevant, needed to be "de-linked." Google reluctantly complied, and has since been busy de-linking many individuals from totally factual news stories about them. But, given that this was the law in Europe, it only did so in Europe. <br /><br /> That resulted in the complaint from France -- to which Google has now responded by saying <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2015/07/implementing-european-not-global-right.html" target="_blank">it <b>will not</b> comply with a global right to be forgotten</a>, because the results would be catastrophic for free speech and the open internet: <blockquote><i> This is a troubling development that risks serious chilling effects on the web. <br /><br /> While the right to be forgotten may now be the law in Europe, it is not the law globally. Moreover, there are innumerable examples around the world where content that is declared illegal under the laws of one country, would be deemed legal in others: Thailand criminalizes some speech that is critical of its King, Turkey criminalizes some speech that is critical of Ataturk, and Russia outlaws some speech that is deemed to be “gay propaganda." <br /><br /> If the [French regulator's] proposed approach were to be embraced as the standard for Internet regulation, we would find ourselves in a race to the bottom. <b>In the end, the Internet would only be as free as the world’s least free place.</b> <br /><br /> We believe that no one country should have the authority to to control what content someone in a second country can access. We also believe this order is disproportionate and unnecessary, given that the overwhelming majority of French internet users—currently around 97%—access a European version of Google’s search engine like google.fr, rather than Google.com or any other version of Google. </i></blockquote> I can't see into the future, but I'll take a wild guess and suggest that the French regulators aren't going to just back down following this response, no matter how reasonable and rational it is. European regulators continue to seem to think the internet can be twisted, censored and molded in their own interest, and don't seem to understand just how badly that will backfire. It's likely that this simple explanation will fall on deaf ears and there will soon be a big fight over this.

It feels like law enforcement issuing a bogus threat to try to sound serious.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150730/06324831799/da-claims-hell-charge-drone-operators-near-wildfires-murder.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150730/06324831799/da-claims-hell-charge-drone-operators-near-wildfires-murder.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150730/06324831799/da-claims-hell-charge-drone-operators-near-wildfires-murder.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566412423/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48932344/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48932344/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

Not Authors";s:4:"link";s:71:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techdirt/feed/~3/lypQu8GcaaY/story01.htm";s:11:"description";s:23995:"<p> One of the more Orwellian aspects of the book world is the number of publisher advocate groups calling themselves Author This and Author That. The <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org">Authors Guild</a>, <a href="http://authorsunited.net">Authors United</a>, the <a href="http://aaronline.org">Association of Authors' Representatives</a>... their devotion to protecting the interests of authors is right there in the names, right? No further inquiry necessary. </p> <p> That's the idea behind the misleading nomenclature, anyway. But even a cursory glance at the behavior of all these "author" organizations reveals their true priorities and actual allegiances. </p> <p> Let's start with the Authors Guild, which <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org/who-we-are/">claims</a> to "have served as the collective voice of American authors," and which describes its mission as "to support working writers. We advocate for the rights of writers by supporting free speech, fair contracts, and copyright. We create community and we fight for a living wage." The Authors Guild even <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org/who-we-are/">proudly notes</a> that it "has initiated lawsuits in defense of authors' rights, where necessary." </p> <p> Leave aside the wooly talk about creating community. How does the collective voice of American authors, the supporter of working writers, the advocate for the rights of writers, go about fighting for that living wage? Especially given that publishers are <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/61042-profits-rose-32-in-2013-at-s-s.html">making more money</a> from digital books <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/56530-profits-jumped-75-at-random-house.html">than ever</a>, and <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2013/06/22/a-major-publisher-jumps-the-shark/">sharing less of that money</a> with authors than ever. </p> <p> Well, the organization has periodically <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/more-authors-guild-nonsense.html" >mentioned in passing</a> that the shockingly low lockstep <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/04/agency-model-sucks.html" >17.5% legacy publisher digital royalty rate</a> <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-ministry-of-authors-united.html" >"needs to change,"</a> so there's that. Sometimes a spokesperson expresses his or her "<a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-authors-guild-do-more-than-hope.html" >hopes</a>" for a little more fairness. And recently they did manage <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/more-authors-guild-nonsense.html" >a whole blog post on the topic</a>. But that's all. Occasional words; zero deeds. And likewise regarding a host of other <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/unconscionability.html" >obvious</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/exploited-writers-in-unfair-industry.html" >longstanding</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/08/for-authors-guild-other-legacy.html" >outrageous</a> legacy publisher abuses such as life-of-copyright (forever) terms, twice-yearly payment provisions, draconian non-compete clauses, and impossible out-of-print clauses. Pro forma words and practiced complicity. </p> <p> But does all this mean the Authors Guild is lying when it says it sometimes initiates lawsuits? </p> <p> Not at all. The organization did sue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc." >Google</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust" >Hathitrust</a> over digitization (the first suit was settled; in the second, the Authors Guild lost). Leave aside the merits of those suits; I think they were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150722/06502731723/aussie-study-infringers-spend-more-content-than-non-infringers.shtml" >wrongheaded</a>, but that's not the point. The point is that when the Authors Guild really wants to throw down, it throws down &#8212; just never against legacy publishers and the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/12/eisler-konrath-vs-hachette.html" >Rich Relationships&#8482;</a> by which they systematically screw authors (in fact, in the Google suit, the Authors Guild fought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc." >alongside</a> the Association of American Publishers). </p> <p> Indeed, at the moment when the Authors Guild had maximum leverage over legacy publishers to extract some actual digital royalty and contract provision concessions &#8212; during <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/08/see-amazon-does-think-books-are-special.html" >Hachette's contract standoff with Amazon</a> &#8212; the organization surrendered that leverage and threw all its Collective Voice of American Authors weight behind <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/12/eisler-konrath-vs-hachette.html" >Hachette</a>. Even though <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/so-real-authors-guild-is-amazon.html" >Hachette's position</a> was <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/04/agency-model-sucks.html" >costing authors money</a>; even though Amazon had <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazons-latest-proposal.html" >repeatedly</a> <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazon-hachette-sounds-of-silence-guest.html" >offered</a> to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140703/13251627775/one-percent-authors-want-to-end-destructive-conflict-bring-order-to-galaxy.shtml" >compensate</a> any authors who were being harmed by the standoff. </p> <p> What's doubly bizarre about the Authors Guild's reflexive anti-Amazon animus is that Amazon stands for so much of what the Authors Guild claims to want. A pristine example: as I write this, the organization bleats on its home page that "Half of Net Proceeds is the Fair Royalty Rate for E-Books," while two lines down <a href="https://twitter.com/barryeisler/status/625862810988253184" >it calls on the government</a> to investigate Amazon&#8230;for paying exactly that fair royalty! </p> <p> Not only does the Authors Guild <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/08/for-authors-guild-other-legacy.html" >refuse to stand up to publishers</a>; it <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/03/presumed-inane.html" >actively</a> <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2013/12/konrath-and-eisler-vs-richard-russo-and.html" >supports</a> them (while <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140723/17420627984/why-does-authors-guild-refuse-to-even-acknowledge-views-authors-who-disagree-with-it.shtml" >censoring the authors</a> it claims to represent). I challenge you to review the organization's <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/richard-russo-strikes-again.html" >public positions</a> and <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2013/04/scott-turow-and-politics-of-cowardice.html" >find a way</a> to <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/03/barry-joe-scott-turow.html" >distinguish</a> <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130408/01345422620/authors-guilds-scott-turow-supreme-court-google-ebooks-libraries-amazon-are-all-destroying-authors.shtml" >them</a> from what you would expect in <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazon-cancer-cure-stunt-to-separate.html" >a legacy publisher press release</a>. I'm being literal here &#8212; legacy publishers and the Authors Guild actually do cite and cross-post each other's press releases. Here's <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/a-message-from-john-sargent-ceo-macmillan/" >an example</a> &#8212; the Authors Guild, approvingly posting on its own site a press release from John Sargent, CEO of Macmillan, who in the release approvingly quotes Scott Turow, then president of the Authors Guild. It's really that incestuous between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >New York Big Five</a> and the Collective Voice of American Authors. </p> <p> If the Authors Guild really wanted to "advocate for fair contracts," it would support self-publishing, which even more than Amazon publishing is empowering authors with the first real competition the industry has ever seen &#8212; a 70% digital royalty rate (four times the lockstep legacy standard); control over packaging and other business decisions; faster time to market. Yet there's nothing on the Authors Guild website about how to use <a href="http://www.amazonkdp.com" >KDP</a>, <a href="https://www.kobo.com/writinglife" >Kobo</a>, <a href="https://www.nookpress.com" >NookPress</a>, <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/about/how_to_publish_on_smashwords" >Smashwords</a>, or any other self-publishing resource. Nothing about <a href="http://authorearnings.com" >AuthorEarnings.com</a>, the most comprehensive breakdown available about where authors are making money in Amazon-, legacy- and self-publishing. The only "self-publishing" resource available through the Collective Voice of American Authors has been a <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/the-case-against-author-solutions-part-1-the-numbers/" >notorious</a> <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2014/12/16/how-jessica-mitford-exposed-a-48m-scam-from-americas-literary-establishment/" >scam</a> <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/author-solutions-and-friends-the-inside-story-2/" >outfit</a> called (naturally) Author Solutions (a relationship the Authors Guild <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2015/05/29/authors-guild-dumps-author-solutions-and-pretends-it-was-all-a-bad-dream/" >finally terminated</a> in May). </p> <p> (Novelist <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com" >David Gaughran</a> has been tireless in exposing Author Solutions' shady practices &#8212; see the preceding links &#8212; and the refusal of establishment publishing media to follow up on his work is at least as revealing as anything else in this article about where true power lies in the industry. Within that refusal there's a great story for an intrepid journalist about concentrated media ownership, how advertising dollars buy silence, and why establishments are so reluctant to examine their own shadiest practices.) </p> <p> Authors United is no different. Against abysmally low digital royalties, Authors United might offer up a bit of pro forma tut-tutting. But the organization's only real action &#8212; in the form of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140703/13251627775/one-percent-authors-want-to-end-destructive-conflict-bring-order-to-galaxy.shtml" >petitions</a>, <a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/authors-united-i-wish-it-were-so/" >monster ads in the New York Times</a>, <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/08/new-york-times-david-streitfeld-jumps.html" >media blitzes</a> <a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/david-streitfeld-is-dangerous-and-disingenuous/" >assisted</a> by <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/10/new-york-times-rebukes-streitfeld-for.html" >pet stenographers</a>, <a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/09/15/authors-united-sends-open-letter-amazon-board-filled-bad-arguments-factual-errors/" >letters to boards of directors</a>, and <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/authors-united-epic-fail-o-rama.html" >letters to the Department of Justice</a> pleading for protection for publishers &#8212; is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/04/war-on-amazon-publishing-writers" >against the company</a> that has sold more books than any other, that has opened up publishing to more authors than ever before, that pays higher royalties than any legacy publisher, that is making more money for more authors than ever before, that pays authors once a month instead of twice a year, that gives authors unprecedented access to sales data, that almost single-handedly ushered in the digital book revolution &#8212; Amazon. </p> <p> All of which is more than a little weird just on the face of it. But it gets even weirder &#8212; and more telling &#8212; when you consider the animating principles Authors United claims in the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/authors-united-epic-fail-o-rama.html" >anti-Amazon screed</a> it recently sent to the Justice Department: </p> <blockquote><i> <p> [We can't have a company using] its technologically supercharged monopoly powers to manipulate and supervise the sale of books and therefore affect the exchange of ideas in America&#8230; </p> <p> The government has the responsibility to maintain an open, competitive, free, unsupervised, and undistorted market for books&#8230; </p> <p> Our larger point is that we believe the Antitrust Division needs to reassess&#8230;overwhelming market power [regarding] any business that has established effective control of a medium of communication&#8230; </p> <p> We believe these steps would restore freedom of choice, competition, vitality, diversity, and free expression in the American book market, while ensuring that the American people&#8212;as individual free citizens and as a democratic community&#8212;determine for themselves how to take advantage of the new technologies of the 21st Century&#8230; </p> </i></blockquote> <p> Lofty principles! But given that Amazon's self-publishing platform enables all authors to publish whatever they like and leaves it to readers to decide what books they themselves find beneficial, while the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >New York Big Five</a> (no concentrated market power in a group with a name like that!) has historically rejected probably 999 books for every one they deem worthy of reaching the public, a few questions present themselves. Such as: </p> <ul> <li>Who has really been manipulating and supervising the sale of books and therefore affecting the exchange of ideas in America, and who has really established effective control of a medium of communication &#8212; an entity that screens out 99.9% of books, or one that has enabled the publication of any book? </li> <li>Who has really been running an uncompetitive, controlled, supervised, distorted market for books &#8212; a company dedicated to lower prices, or a group calling itself the Big Five that has been found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc." >guilty of conspiracy and price fixing</a> </li> <li>Who is really restoring freedom of choice, competition, vitality, diversity, and free expression in the American book market &#8212; an entity that consigns to oblivion 999 books out of a thousand, or one that enables the publication of all of them? </li> <li>And who is really ensuring that the American people determine for themselves how to take advantage of the new technologies of the 21st Century &#8212; an entity responsible for <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/12/eisler-konrath-vs-hachette.html" >zero innovation</a> and dedicated to preserving the position of paper, or one that has popularized a new publishing and reading platform that for the first time offers readers an actual choice of formats? </li> </ul> <p> Measured against every one of the lofty principles Authors United claims to champion, the Big Five is a historical disaster; Amazon, a reformist boon. The organization decries Amazon's alleged abuse of its publisher suppliers (<a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/10/amazon-will-slash-your-royalties.html" >monopsony</a>!), yet offers not even a word about how legacy publishers <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/unconscionability.html" >consistently</a> <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/exploited-writers-in-unfair-industry.html" >abuse</a> their own suppliers &#8212; the group commonly known as authors. Against legacy publisher abuses, silence; against the company that offers an alternative to those abuses, coordinated, well-funded attacks by a stable of celebrity authors (accompanied by admittedly hilarious claims to be "<a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/09/24/authors-united-call-antitrust-inquiry-amazon/#.VCMeq76oW-V" >not taking sides</a>"). </p> <p> Follow any of the links above to the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/07/authors-behaving-badly-and-authors-who.html" >various positions</a> Authors United has taken, and repeat that handy "how do these positions differ from those of any legacy publisher?" exercise. You'll see almost complete redundancy between the positions of Authors United and those of, say, the Association of American Publishers. They might as well be the same organization. The only real difference is that one honestly declares that it represents the interests of publishers, while the other dishonestly pretends to represent the interests of authors. </p> <p> Now let's look at the Association of Authors' Representatives, which, judging from what it has named itself, one might reasonably imagine is in the business of representing the interests of&#8230;authors. </p> <p> So: when the Justice Department and 16 States Attorneys General charged the New York <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >Big Five</a> with <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/10/us-apple-ebooks-idUSBRE9690GE20130710" >colluding to fix prices</a>, did the AAR cheer? No. Instead, they <a href="http://www.thepassivevoice.com/05/2012/bizarre-misunderstanding-of-e-book-business/" >lobbied</a> the Justice Department on <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/simon-says.html" >behalf</a> of <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/aar-fail.html" >the publishers</a>. And when three of the Big Five settled with the Department of Justice, did the AAR, say, offer a public statement on behalf of the authors whose <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/04/agency-model-sucks.html" >interests</a> <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/so-real-authors-guild-is-amazon.html" >price-fixing had damaged</a>? No. Instead, it protested the settlement &#8220;in the strongest possible terms&#8221; in a letter to the DOJ&#8230;<a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/aar-fail.html" >on behalf of the publishers</a>. </p> <p> But when Penguin and Random House merged &#8212; inarguably increasing the already Olympian clout of the Big Five relative to authors, narrowing author alternatives, concentrating market power, diminishing choice, <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/penguin-random-house-merger-helps-author-solutions-exploit-writers/" >empowering a company notorious for scamming authors</a>, etc., did the AAR write to the Justice Department to oppose the merger? Did the organization take any meaningful action at all? </p> <p> Crickets. </p> <p> And has this organization that purports to represent authors ever protested &#8220;in the strongest possible terms&#8221; any of the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/unconscionability.html" >longstanding</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/exploited-writers-in-unfair-industry.html" >widespread</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/08/for-authors-guild-other-legacy.html" >abusive</a> publisher practices noted above? </p> <p> Against actual legacy publisher abuses, tepid words at best. In support of legacy publisher collusion, The Strongest Possible Terms. </p> <p> All of which gives the lie to the oft-repeated Authors United claim that Amazon <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/authors-united-epic-fail-o-rama.html" >&#8220;retaliates&#8221;</a> against authors. There&#8217;s <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/douglas-prestons-fail-thon-continues.html" >no evidence</a> at all for this charge; in fact, were it true, it&#8217;s hard to imagine how the books of every Authors United member, even those of floridly outspoken Authors United pitchman <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/douglas-prestons-fail-thon-continues.html" >Doug Preston</a>, would be available on Amazon, despite all the <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazon-cancer-cure-stunt-to-separate.html" >crazy accusations</a> and anti-Amazon advocacy. These &#8220;author&#8221; organizations demonstrably have no fear at all of crossing Amazon. But the one group they never cross is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >New York Big Five</a>. Which is about all you need to know about where real retaliation, and real power, lies in the book industry. </p> <p> Sometimes making a name misleadingly vague can serve an organization&#8217;s tactical interests &#8212; think the National Security Agency (it wouldn't do to call it the National Surveillance Agency) or the Chamber of Commerce (can't very well call itself the Big Business Lobbyist). Other times, organizations deliberately choose names that are the opposite of reality &#8212; calling a surveillance law the Freedom Act, for example, or a group dedicated to preventing gay marriage calling itself the National Organization for Marriage. It's the latter tradition in which all these allegedly author-centric groups belong. To call out their real priorities, their primary affiliations, in their names would be to reduce their effectiveness. </p> <p> Now look, there’s nothing wrong with lobbying the government on behalf of big publishers. The First Amendment guarantees the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances, after all, and it doesn’t say those grievances can’t be self-serving or even that they have to be sane. I just wish all these organizations pretending to advocate for authors would call themselves something a little more honest. Power in publishing is already horrendously lopsided. Publisher lobbyists masquerading as author champions only makes things worse. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/15551431793/authors-guilded-united-representing-not-authors.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/15551431793/authors-guilded-united-representing-not-authors.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/15551431793/authors-guilded-united-representing-not-authors.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48928022/sc/32/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

The <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org">Authors Guild</a>, <a href="http://authorsunited.net">Authors United</a>, the <a href="http://aaronline.org">Association of Authors' Representatives</a>... their devotion to protecting the interests of authors is right there in the names, right? No further inquiry necessary. </p> <p> That's the idea behind the misleading nomenclature, anyway. But even a cursory glance at the behavior of all these "author" organizations reveals their true priorities and actual allegiances. </p> <p> Let's start with the Authors Guild, which <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org/who-we-are/">claims</a> to "have served as the collective voice of American authors," and which describes its mission as "to support working writers. We advocate for the rights of writers by supporting free speech, fair contracts, and copyright. We create community and we fight for a living wage." The Authors Guild even <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org/who-we-are/">proudly notes</a> that it "has initiated lawsuits in defense of authors' rights, where necessary." </p> <p> Leave aside the wooly talk about creating community. How does the collective voice of American authors, the supporter of working writers, the advocate for the rights of writers, go about fighting for that living wage? Especially given that publishers are <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/61042-profits-rose-32-in-2013-at-s-s.html">making more money</a> from digital books <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/56530-profits-jumped-75-at-random-house.html">than ever</a>, and <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2013/06/22/a-major-publisher-jumps-the-shark/">sharing less of that money</a> with authors than ever. </p> <p> Well, the organization has periodically <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/more-authors-guild-nonsense.html" >mentioned in passing</a> that the shockingly low lockstep <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/04/agency-model-sucks.html" >17.5% legacy publisher digital royalty rate</a> <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-ministry-of-authors-united.html" >"needs to change,"</a> so there's that. Sometimes a spokesperson expresses his or her "<a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-authors-guild-do-more-than-hope.html" >hopes</a>" for a little more fairness. And recently they did manage <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/more-authors-guild-nonsense.html" >a whole blog post on the topic</a>. But that's all. Occasional words; zero deeds. And likewise regarding a host of other <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/unconscionability.html" >obvious</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/exploited-writers-in-unfair-industry.html" >longstanding</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/08/for-authors-guild-other-legacy.html" >outrageous</a> legacy publisher abuses such as life-of-copyright (forever) terms, twice-yearly payment provisions, draconian non-compete clauses, and impossible out-of-print clauses. Pro forma words and practiced complicity. </p> <p> But does all this mean the Authors Guild is lying when it says it sometimes initiates lawsuits? </p> <p> Not at all. The organization did sue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc." >Google</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust" >Hathitrust</a> over digitization (the first suit was settled; in the second, the Authors Guild lost). Leave aside the merits of those suits; I think they were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150722/06502731723/aussie-study-infringers-spend-more-content-than-non-infringers.shtml" >wrongheaded</a>, but that's not the point. The point is that when the Authors Guild really wants to throw down, it throws down &#8212; just never against legacy publishers and the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/12/eisler-konrath-vs-hachette.html" >Rich Relationships&#8482;</a> by which they systematically screw authors (in fact, in the Google suit, the Authors Guild fought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc." >alongside</a> the Association of American Publishers). </p> <p> Indeed, at the moment when the Authors Guild had maximum leverage over legacy publishers to extract some actual digital royalty and contract provision concessions &#8212; during <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/08/see-amazon-does-think-books-are-special.html" >Hachette's contract standoff with Amazon</a> &#8212; the organization surrendered that leverage and threw all its Collective Voice of American Authors weight behind <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/12/eisler-konrath-vs-hachette.html" >Hachette</a>. Even though <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/so-real-authors-guild-is-amazon.html" >Hachette's position</a> was <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/04/agency-model-sucks.html" >costing authors money</a>; even though Amazon had <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazons-latest-proposal.html" >repeatedly</a> <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazon-hachette-sounds-of-silence-guest.html" >offered</a> to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140703/13251627775/one-percent-authors-want-to-end-destructive-conflict-bring-order-to-galaxy.shtml" >compensate</a> any authors who were being harmed by the standoff. </p> <p> What's doubly bizarre about the Authors Guild's reflexive anti-Amazon animus is that Amazon stands for so much of what the Authors Guild claims to want. A pristine example: as I write this, the organization bleats on its home page that "Half of Net Proceeds is the Fair Royalty Rate for E-Books," while two lines down <a href="https://twitter.com/barryeisler/status/625862810988253184" >it calls on the government</a> to investigate Amazon&#8230;for paying exactly that fair royalty! </p> <p> Not only does the Authors Guild <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/08/for-authors-guild-other-legacy.html" >refuse to stand up to publishers</a>; it <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/03/presumed-inane.html" >actively</a> <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2013/12/konrath-and-eisler-vs-richard-russo-and.html" >supports</a> them (while <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140723/17420627984/why-does-authors-guild-refuse-to-even-acknowledge-views-authors-who-disagree-with-it.shtml" >censoring the authors</a> it claims to represent). I challenge you to review the organization's <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/richard-russo-strikes-again.html" >public positions</a> and <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2013/04/scott-turow-and-politics-of-cowardice.html" >find a way</a> to <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/03/barry-joe-scott-turow.html" >distinguish</a> <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130408/01345422620/authors-guilds-scott-turow-supreme-court-google-ebooks-libraries-amazon-are-all-destroying-authors.shtml" >them</a> from what you would expect in <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazon-cancer-cure-stunt-to-separate.html" >a legacy publisher press release</a>. I'm being literal here &#8212; legacy publishers and the Authors Guild actually do cite and cross-post each other's press releases. Here's <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/a-message-from-john-sargent-ceo-macmillan/" >an example</a> &#8212; the Authors Guild, approvingly posting on its own site a press release from John Sargent, CEO of Macmillan, who in the release approvingly quotes Scott Turow, then president of the Authors Guild. It's really that incestuous between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >New York Big Five</a> and the Collective Voice of American Authors. </p> <p> If the Authors Guild really wanted to "advocate for fair contracts," it would support self-publishing, which even more than Amazon publishing is empowering authors with the first real competition the industry has ever seen &#8212; a 70% digital royalty rate (four times the lockstep legacy standard); control over packaging and other business decisions; faster time to market. Yet there's nothing on the Authors Guild website about how to use <a href="http://www.amazonkdp.com" >KDP</a>, <a href="https://www.kobo.com/writinglife" >Kobo</a>, <a href="https://www.nookpress.com" >NookPress</a>, <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/about/how_to_publish_on_smashwords" >Smashwords</a>, or any other self-publishing resource. Nothing about <a href="http://authorearnings.com" >AuthorEarnings.com</a>, the most comprehensive breakdown available about where authors are making money in Amazon-, legacy- and self-publishing. The only "self-publishing" resource available through the Collective Voice of American Authors has been a <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/the-case-against-author-solutions-part-1-the-numbers/" >notorious</a> <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2014/12/16/how-jessica-mitford-exposed-a-48m-scam-from-americas-literary-establishment/" >scam</a> <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/author-solutions-and-friends-the-inside-story-2/" >outfit</a> called (naturally) Author Solutions (a relationship the Authors Guild <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2015/05/29/authors-guild-dumps-author-solutions-and-pretends-it-was-all-a-bad-dream/" >finally terminated</a> in May). </p> <p> (Novelist <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com" >David Gaughran</a> has been tireless in exposing Author Solutions' shady practices &#8212; see the preceding links &#8212; and the refusal of establishment publishing media to follow up on his work is at least as revealing as anything else in this article about where true power lies in the industry. Within that refusal there's a great story for an intrepid journalist about concentrated media ownership, how advertising dollars buy silence, and why establishments are so reluctant to examine their own shadiest practices.) </p> <p> Authors United is no different. Against abysmally low digital royalties, Authors United might offer up a bit of pro forma tut-tutting. But the organization's only real action &#8212; in the form of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140703/13251627775/one-percent-authors-want-to-end-destructive-conflict-bring-order-to-galaxy.shtml" >petitions</a>, <a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/authors-united-i-wish-it-were-so/" >monster ads in the New York Times</a>, <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/08/new-york-times-david-streitfeld-jumps.html" >media blitzes</a> <a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/david-streitfeld-is-dangerous-and-disingenuous/" >assisted</a> by <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/10/new-york-times-rebukes-streitfeld-for.html" >pet stenographers</a>, <a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/09/15/authors-united-sends-open-letter-amazon-board-filled-bad-arguments-factual-errors/" >letters to boards of directors</a>, and <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/authors-united-epic-fail-o-rama.html" >letters to the Department of Justice</a> pleading for protection for publishers &#8212; is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/04/war-on-amazon-publishing-writers" >against the company</a> that has sold more books than any other, that has opened up publishing to more authors than ever before, that pays higher royalties than any legacy publisher, that is making more money for more authors than ever before, that pays authors once a month instead of twice a year, that gives authors unprecedented access to sales data, that almost single-handedly ushered in the digital book revolution &#8212; Amazon. </p> <p> All of which is more than a little weird just on the face of it. But it gets even weirder &#8212; and more telling &#8212; when you consider the animating principles Authors United claims in the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/authors-united-epic-fail-o-rama.html" >anti-Amazon screed</a> it recently sent to the Justice Department: </p> <blockquote><i> <p> [We can't have a company using] its technologically supercharged monopoly powers to manipulate and supervise the sale of books and therefore affect the exchange of ideas in America&#8230; </p> <p> The government has the responsibility to maintain an open, competitive, free, unsupervised, and undistorted market for books&#8230; </p> <p> Our larger point is that we believe the Antitrust Division needs to reassess&#8230;overwhelming market power [regarding] any business that has established effective control of a medium of communication&#8230; </p> <p> We believe these steps would restore freedom of choice, competition, vitality, diversity, and free expression in the American book market, while ensuring that the American people&#8212;as individual free citizens and as a democratic community&#8212;determine for themselves how to take advantage of the new technologies of the 21st Century&#8230; </p> </i></blockquote> <p> Lofty principles! But given that Amazon's self-publishing platform enables all authors to publish whatever they like and leaves it to readers to decide what books they themselves find beneficial, while the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >New York Big Five</a> (no concentrated market power in a group with a name like that!) has historically rejected probably 999 books for every one they deem worthy of reaching the public, a few questions present themselves. Such as: </p> <ul> <li>Who has really been manipulating and supervising the sale of books and therefore affecting the exchange of ideas in America, and who has really established effective control of a medium of communication &#8212; an entity that screens out 99.9% of books, or one that has enabled the publication of any book? </li> <li>Who has really been running an uncompetitive, controlled, supervised, distorted market for books &#8212; a company dedicated to lower prices, or a group calling itself the Big Five that has been found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc." >guilty of conspiracy and price fixing</a> </li> <li>Who is really restoring freedom of choice, competition, vitality, diversity, and free expression in the American book market &#8212; an entity that consigns to oblivion 999 books out of a thousand, or one that enables the publication of all of them? </li> <li>And who is really ensuring that the American people determine for themselves how to take advantage of the new technologies of the 21st Century &#8212; an entity responsible for <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2011/12/eisler-konrath-vs-hachette.html" >zero innovation</a> and dedicated to preserving the position of paper, or one that has popularized a new publishing and reading platform that for the first time offers readers an actual choice of formats? </li> </ul> <p> Measured against every one of the lofty principles Authors United claims to champion, the Big Five is a historical disaster; Amazon, a reformist boon. The organization decries Amazon's alleged abuse of its publisher suppliers (<a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/10/amazon-will-slash-your-royalties.html" >monopsony</a>!), yet offers not even a word about how legacy publishers <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/unconscionability.html" >consistently</a> <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/exploited-writers-in-unfair-industry.html" >abuse</a> their own suppliers &#8212; the group commonly known as authors. Against legacy publisher abuses, silence; against the company that offers an alternative to those abuses, coordinated, well-funded attacks by a stable of celebrity authors (accompanied by admittedly hilarious claims to be "<a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/09/24/authors-united-call-antitrust-inquiry-amazon/#.VCMeq76oW-V" >not taking sides</a>"). </p> <p> Follow any of the links above to the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/07/authors-behaving-badly-and-authors-who.html" >various positions</a> Authors United has taken, and repeat that handy "how do these positions differ from those of any legacy publisher?" exercise. You'll see almost complete redundancy between the positions of Authors United and those of, say, the Association of American Publishers. They might as well be the same organization. The only real difference is that one honestly declares that it represents the interests of publishers, while the other dishonestly pretends to represent the interests of authors. </p> <p> Now let's look at the Association of Authors' Representatives, which, judging from what it has named itself, one might reasonably imagine is in the business of representing the interests of&#8230;authors. </p> <p> So: when the Justice Department and 16 States Attorneys General charged the New York <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >Big Five</a> with <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/10/us-apple-ebooks-idUSBRE9690GE20130710" >colluding to fix prices</a>, did the AAR cheer? No. Instead, they <a href="http://www.thepassivevoice.com/05/2012/bizarre-misunderstanding-of-e-book-business/" >lobbied</a> the Justice Department on <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/simon-says.html" >behalf</a> of <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/aar-fail.html" >the publishers</a>. And when three of the Big Five settled with the Department of Justice, did the AAR, say, offer a public statement on behalf of the authors whose <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/04/agency-model-sucks.html" >interests</a> <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/so-real-authors-guild-is-amazon.html" >price-fixing had damaged</a>? No. Instead, it protested the settlement &#8220;in the strongest possible terms&#8221; in a letter to the DOJ&#8230;<a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/aar-fail.html" >on behalf of the publishers</a>. </p> <p> But when Penguin and Random House merged &#8212; inarguably increasing the already Olympian clout of the Big Five relative to authors, narrowing author alternatives, concentrating market power, diminishing choice, <a href="https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/penguin-random-house-merger-helps-author-solutions-exploit-writers/" >empowering a company notorious for scamming authors</a>, etc., did the AAR write to the Justice Department to oppose the merger? Did the organization take any meaningful action at all? </p> <p> Crickets. </p> <p> And has this organization that purports to represent authors ever protested &#8220;in the strongest possible terms&#8221; any of the <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/unconscionability.html" >longstanding</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/05/exploited-writers-in-unfair-industry.html" >widespread</a>, <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2014/08/for-authors-guild-other-legacy.html" >abusive</a> publisher practices noted above? </p> <p> Against actual legacy publisher abuses, tepid words at best. In support of legacy publisher collusion, The Strongest Possible Terms. </p> <p> All of which gives the lie to the oft-repeated Authors United claim that Amazon <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/authors-united-epic-fail-o-rama.html" >&#8220;retaliates&#8221;</a> against authors. There&#8217;s <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/douglas-prestons-fail-thon-continues.html" >no evidence</a> at all for this charge; in fact, were it true, it&#8217;s hard to imagine how the books of every Authors United member, even those of floridly outspoken Authors United pitchman <a href="http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2015/07/douglas-prestons-fail-thon-continues.html" >Doug Preston</a>, would be available on Amazon, despite all the <a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/07/amazon-cancer-cure-stunt-to-separate.html" >crazy accusations</a> and anti-Amazon advocacy. These &#8220;author&#8221; organizations demonstrably have no fear at all of crossing Amazon. But the one group they never cross is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" >New York Big Five</a>. Which is about all you need to know about where real retaliation, and real power, lies in the book industry. </p> <p> Sometimes making a name misleadingly vague can serve an organization&#8217;s tactical interests &#8212; think the National Security Agency (it wouldn't do to call it the National Surveillance Agency) or the Chamber of Commerce (can't very well call itself the Big Business Lobbyist). Other times, organizations deliberately choose names that are the opposite of reality &#8212; calling a surveillance law the Freedom Act, for example, or a group dedicated to preventing gay marriage calling itself the National Organization for Marriage. It's the latter tradition in which all these allegedly author-centric groups belong. To call out their real priorities, their primary affiliations, in their names would be to reduce their effectiveness. </p> <p> Now look, there’s nothing wrong with lobbying the government on behalf of big publishers. The First Amendment guarantees the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances, after all, and it doesn’t say those grievances can’t be self-serving or even that they have to be sane. I just wish all these organizations pretending to advocate for authors would call themselves something a little more honest. Power in publishing is already horrendously lopsided. Publisher lobbyists masquerading as author champions only makes things worse. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/15551431793/authors-guilded-united-representing-not-authors.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/15551431793/authors-guilded-united-representing-not-authors.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/15551431793/authors-guilded-united-representing-not-authors.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566426698/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48928022/sc/32/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48928022/sc/32/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

Now the major movie studios are pushing for key items on their wish list as negotiators hammer out the final details of an Asia-Pacific trade agreement. The studios hope the 12 countries working on the pact will agree to copyright protections that, in many cases, last longer than what’s currently in place, Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer reports. <br /><br /> The movie studios also want stricter penalties on piracy, especially as Internet access expands throughout the region. </i></blockquote> And, because the USTR almost always gives in to Hollywood (it helps that the MPAA <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140422/06011926988/revolving-door-mpaa-hires-chief-ustr-negotiator-behind-acta-tpps-ip-chapter.shtml">hired</a> the top USTR negotiator on IP last year, so the current negotiators recognize that their next jobs are on the line with this agreement), it appears that the US has convinced a bunch of other countries -- who should know better -- to <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/TPP-nations-near-deal-on-70-year-copyright-protection" target="_blank">agree to lock in a life + 70-year copyright term</a>, <i>even as</i> the US Copyright Office has suggested that current copyright terms are too long and should be <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130315/09225322338/surprise-register-copyrights-expected-to-call-reduction-copyright-term.shtml">scaled back</a>. <br /><br /> There is no way to explain this as anything but selling out the public interest to appease corporate interests of Hollywood. It's a fairly disgusting display of the kind of "dealmaking" that the USTR has been pushing for more quietly for years, but now that it has fast track, it knows it can play hardball to help its friends in Hollywood.

Politico notes that now that fast track is in hand and the USTR has more or less free rein in completing the negotiations, Hollywood has jumped in with a <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningtech/0715/morningtech19344.html" target="_blank">bunch of demands to expand copyright laws</a> via TPP: <blockquote><i> We've seen the Hollywood versus tech copyright fight play out over everything from SOPA to the Library of Congress. Now the major movie studios are pushing for key items on their wish list as negotiators hammer out the final details of an Asia-Pacific trade agreement. The studios hope the 12 countries working on the pact will agree to copyright protections that, in many cases, last longer than what’s currently in place, Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer reports. <br /><br /> The movie studios also want stricter penalties on piracy, especially as Internet access expands throughout the region. </i></blockquote> And, because the USTR almost always gives in to Hollywood (it helps that the MPAA <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140422/06011926988/revolving-door-mpaa-hires-chief-ustr-negotiator-behind-acta-tpps-ip-chapter.shtml">hired</a> the top USTR negotiator on IP last year, so the current negotiators recognize that their next jobs are on the line with this agreement), it appears that the US has convinced a bunch of other countries -- who should know better -- to <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/TPP-nations-near-deal-on-70-year-copyright-protection" target="_blank">agree to lock in a life + 70-year copyright term</a>, <i>even as</i> the US Copyright Office has suggested that current copyright terms are too long and should be <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130315/09225322338/surprise-register-copyrights-expected-to-call-reduction-copyright-term.shtml">scaled back</a>. <br /><br /> There is no way to explain this as anything but selling out the public interest to appease corporate interests of Hollywood. It's a fairly disgusting display of the kind of "dealmaking" that the USTR has been pushing for more quietly for years, but now that it has fast track, it knows it can play hardball to help its friends in Hollywood. Fuck the public domain, Hollywood wants to keep getting paid for works from decades ago.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/22185031795/now-that-ustr-has-fast-track-hollywood-ramps-up-demands-while-ustr-brushes-off-public-interest-group-concerns.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/22185031795/now-that-ustr-has-fast-track-hollywood-ramps-up-demands-while-ustr-brushes-off-public-interest-group-concerns.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/22185031795/now-that-ustr-has-fast-track-hollywood-ramps-up-demands-while-ustr-brushes-off-public-interest-group-concerns.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566380912/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/48922741/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/48922741/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

The starting point of his post -- and his problems -- trace back a few years. <blockquote> <i>In 2012, it was discovered that a chemist working at the Massachusetts state drug lab in Jamaica Plain <a href="http://www.wbur.org/2012/12/17/drug-lab-charges" target="_blank">had been falsifying drug tests</a> (e.g., claiming that samples contained narcotics without testing them and even adding cocaine to samples to get a positive result when prior testing came back negative). She had worked at the lab for nearly a decade, and these revelations called into question the outcomes in tens of thousands of cases.</i></blockquote> Obviously, this sort of tampering means there are convictions waiting to be overturned. But two years later, little progress has been made. It isn't that the state is obstructing efforts to make the falsely-convicted whole again (there may be some of that, but Colarusso's post doesn't indicate there is), but that nearly a decade's-worth of bogus lab work potentially infects thousands of convictions. Narrowing down this list to those directly affected is an enormous task, one that Colarusso was tasked with making more manageable. Narrowing down "The List" to a single link in the evidence chain -- the drug receipt -- still returned far too many potential matches to be of use. Additional restrictions trimmed the possible matches a bit more, but still left far too many potential victims of the chemist's work. <blockquote> <i>Staff attorneys take only a small fraction of indigent cases. The majority are handled by private attorneys. So only a subset of defendants on The List would be in our client files. However, given The List contained nearly 40,000 names, this subset was still rather sizable. So we used some nice open source software to look for matches between our clients&#8217; names and those found on the list (this involved some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a> in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a> along with the creation of a nice <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" target="_blank">IPython Notebook</a> or two). This gave us a rough list of clients on The List, and we used these names to create a list of their co-defendants.</i></blockquote> The narrowing of the field only did so much. The List remained sizable, thanks to inconsistencies inherent in the system itself. <blockquote> <i>This gave us a rough list of clients on The List, and we used these names to create a list of their co-defendants. We then checked The List for the co-defendant names. Unfortunately, a lot of these were missing. If we assumed the same rate of missing names across all cases, it seemed The List was missing somewhere between 0 and 9,600 names. Wait, what? That&#8217;s right, thousands of potentially missing names. The uncertainty came from the fact that we had to match names. The List did not come with dates of birth, addresses, or Social Security Numbers&#8212;just names. So occasionally, we could not find a name we were looking for because the Commonwealth and CPCS disagreed on the spelling of a name or someone made a transcription error.</i></blockquote> By this point in the investigation, the master list was still huge and it was obvious the list itself was missing hundreds of names, which meant hundreds of possibly wrongly-convicted citizens. The reality of this situation was this: to track down those missing names and to finally set the wheels of justice in motion, thousands of police reports would need to be read and cross-referenced against those on the master list. But who will do this? And with what funds? That's still unclear. It all depends on who feels justice should be served and who feels justice should be served, but only up to a certain dollar amount. <br /><br /> So, the problem -- which was <i>one </i>person in <i>one </i>lab falsifying <i>thousands </i>of test results -- has become something so unwieldy that it may never result in the exoneration of everyone chemist Annie Dookhan managed to wrongly put behind bars. The problem is too big to solve, and much of that has to do with the efficiency of drug prosecutions versus the much less efficient wheels of bureaucracy. Data wrangling helped determine the <i>size </i>of the problem and point a way towards a solution, but the solution is still hundreds, if not thousands, of hours away. <br /><br /> But Colarusso points to one aspect that should have been noticed and would have kept this from becoming a 40,000-file catastrophe (and that's without counting the undetermined number of omissions). <blockquote> <i>The real promise is in catching the next scandal early. This means listening to data and looking for patterns. <a href="http://badchemistry.wbur.org/2013/05/15/annie-dookhan-drug-testing-productivity" target="_blank">The rogue chemist had a throughput three times that of the next &#8220;most productive&#8221; chemist</a>. That should have been a red flag.

The starting point of his post -- and his problems -- trace back a few years. <blockquote> <i>In 2012, it was discovered that a chemist working at the Massachusetts state drug lab in Jamaica Plain <a href="http://www.wbur.org/2012/12/17/drug-lab-charges" target="_blank">had been falsifying drug tests</a> (e.g., claiming that samples contained narcotics without testing them and even adding cocaine to samples to get a positive result when prior testing came back negative). She had worked at the lab for nearly a decade, and these revelations called into question the outcomes in tens of thousands of cases.</i></blockquote> Obviously, this sort of tampering means there are convictions waiting to be overturned. But two years later, little progress has been made. It isn't that the state is obstructing efforts to make the falsely-convicted whole again (there may be some of that, but Colarusso's post doesn't indicate there is), but that nearly a decade's-worth of bogus lab work potentially infects thousands of convictions. Narrowing down this list to those directly affected is an enormous task, one that Colarusso was tasked with making more manageable. Narrowing down "The List" to a single link in the evidence chain -- the drug receipt -- still returned far too many potential matches to be of use. Additional restrictions trimmed the possible matches a bit more, but still left far too many potential victims of the chemist's work. <blockquote> <i>Staff attorneys take only a small fraction of indigent cases. The majority are handled by private attorneys. So only a subset of defendants on The List would be in our client files. However, given The List contained nearly 40,000 names, this subset was still rather sizable. So we used some nice open source software to look for matches between our clients&#8217; names and those found on the list (this involved some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a> in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a> along with the creation of a nice <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" target="_blank">IPython Notebook</a> or two). This gave us a rough list of clients on The List, and we used these names to create a list of their co-defendants.</i></blockquote> The narrowing of the field only did so much. The List remained sizable, thanks to inconsistencies inherent in the system itself. <blockquote> <i>This gave us a rough list of clients on The List, and we used these names to create a list of their co-defendants. We then checked The List for the co-defendant names. Unfortunately, a lot of these were missing. If we assumed the same rate of missing names across all cases, it seemed The List was missing somewhere between 0 and 9,600 names. Wait, what? That&#8217;s right, thousands of potentially missing names. The uncertainty came from the fact that we had to match names. The List did not come with dates of birth, addresses, or Social Security Numbers&#8212;just names. So occasionally, we could not find a name we were looking for because the Commonwealth and CPCS disagreed on the spelling of a name or someone made a transcription error.</i></blockquote> By this point in the investigation, the master list was still huge and it was obvious the list itself was missing hundreds of names, which meant hundreds of possibly wrongly-convicted citizens. The reality of this situation was this: to track down those missing names and to finally set the wheels of justice in motion, thousands of police reports would need to be read and cross-referenced against those on the master list. But who will do this? And with what funds? That's still unclear. It all depends on who feels justice should be served and who feels justice should be served, but only up to a certain dollar amount. <br /><br /> So, the problem -- which was <i>one </i>person in <i>one </i>lab falsifying <i>thousands </i>of test results -- has become something so unwieldy that it may never result in the exoneration of everyone chemist Annie Dookhan managed to wrongly put behind bars. The problem is too big to solve, and much of that has to do with the efficiency of drug prosecutions versus the much less efficient wheels of bureaucracy. Data wrangling helped determine the <i>size </i>of the problem and point a way towards a solution, but the solution is still hundreds, if not thousands, of hours away. <br /><br /> But Colarusso points to one aspect that should have been noticed and would have kept this from becoming a 40,000-file catastrophe (and that's without counting the undetermined number of omissions). <blockquote> <i>The real promise is in catching the next scandal early. This means listening to data and looking for patterns. <a href="http://badchemistry.wbur.org/2013/05/15/annie-dookhan-drug-testing-productivity" target="_blank">The rogue chemist had a throughput three times that of the next &#8220;most productive&#8221; chemist</a>. That should have been a red flag. Data science offers the promise of mining data for signals such as these and sounding the alarm.</i></blockquote> But they weren't looking for a problem at the drug lab. They were looking for productivity. Dookhan's suspiciously-fast output wasn't greeted with suspicion. <a href="http://badchemistry.wbur.org/2013/05/15/annie-dookhan-drug-testing-productivity" target="_blank">It was greeted with praise and an increased workload</a>. <blockquote> <i>The report shows that the Hinton lab leaned heavily on Dookhan&#8217;s productivity.

Also, on the Github page, there is a list of "usage guidelines" which includes lines such as saying if you modify the dataset "you must make it clear that the resulting dataset has been modified by you." Of course, that's not actually required. Most of the other "guidelines" are more in the form of a request -- which is fine -- rather than a command. Of course, it's not even clear if the data in the dataset even could be covered by copyright, as most of it appears to be factual data (names of projects, dates, sizes, etc.) which would be akin to a phone book -- whose data are decidedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co." target="_blank">not</a> covered by copyright. <br /><br /> So, yes, it's always great to see more people embracing the public domain, and it's unquestionably great that MoMA is releasing all this data in an easily accessible format without restrictions.

Not only has it proudly embraced Creative Commons by displaying CC's own logo as <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/works/188564" target="_blanK">a part of its collection</a>, it has <a href="https://medium.com/digital-moma/thousands-of-exhausted-things-or-why-we-dedicated-moma-s-collection-data-to-the-public-domain-7e0a7165e99" target="_blank">decided to release data on over 125,000 works</a> into the public domain by <a href="https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection" target="_blank">posting them to Github</a> using a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0" target="_blank">cc0</a> public domain dedication. <br /><br /> Unfortunately, the data included <b>does not</b> include images of the artwork, which would have been a much more impressive move. Also, on the Github page, there is a list of "usage guidelines" which includes lines such as saying if you modify the dataset "you must make it clear that the resulting dataset has been modified by you." Of course, that's not actually required. Most of the other "guidelines" are more in the form of a request -- which is fine -- rather than a command. Of course, it's not even clear if the data in the dataset even could be covered by copyright, as most of it appears to be factual data (names of projects, dates, sizes, etc.) which would be akin to a phone book -- whose data are decidedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co." target="_blank">not</a> covered by copyright. <br /><br /> So, yes, it's always great to see more people embracing the public domain, and it's unquestionably great that MoMA is releasing all this data in an easily accessible format without restrictions. But it could still go even further. Hopefully we'll soon reach an age when this kind of thing is just standard operating procedure, rather than it being considered a big thing to release some datasets to the public to use.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/11164231791/moma-releases-data-125000-art-works-to-public.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/11164231791/moma-releases-data-125000-art-works-to-public.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/11164231791/moma-releases-data-125000-art-works-to-public.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566392830/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488e70f3/sc/28/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/488e70f3/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

It also informs their tactics. But law enforcement only cherry-picks what it likes about the military. Horton's article for the Washington Post points out that law enforcement officers don't handle their weapons like military members do. Soldiers are taught that guns are deadly and should only be pointed at targets the soldier intends to kill. Police officers are taught to use their guns for intimidation, without nearly as much attention paid to drilling home the point that guns are deadly and should be respected -- especially by the ones wielding them. <blockquote> <i>[Erik] Rhoads, the Fairfax County police lieutenant, was upfront about this mind-set. <b>He explained that it was standard procedure to point guns at suspects in many cases to protect the lives of police officers. Their firearm rules were different from mine; they aimed not to kill but to intimidate. </b>According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/06/30/distraught-people-deadly-results/" target="_blank">reporting by The Washington Post</a>, those rules are established in police training, which often emphasizes a violent response over deescalation. Recruits spend an average of eight hours learning how to neutralize tense situations; they spend more than seven times as many hours at the weapons range.</i> </blockquote> This is what turns a report of a squatter in an apartment into a fully-armed raid. It didn't have to be this way. This "situation" could have been defused at any point before the officers rushed into the apartment with weapons drawn. The security guard at the complex could have been asked about the person in the model apartment. The apartment's owner and management could have provided helpful information as well. But no one -- not even Shift Commander Erik Rhoads -- even considered arming police officers with additional information. They had guns and the authority to use them. That was enough. <blockquote> <i>When I later visited the Fairfax County police station to gather details about what went wrong, I met the shift commander, Lt. Erik Rhoads. I asked why his officers hadn&#8217;t contacted management before they raided the apartment. Why did they classify the incident as a forced entry, when the information they had suggested something innocuous? Why not evaluate the situation before escalating it?</i> <br /><br /> <i>Rhoads defended the procedure, calling the officers&#8217; actions &#8220;on point.&#8221; <b>It&#8217;s not standard to conduct investigations beforehand because that delays the apprehension of suspects</b>, he told me.</i> </blockquote> It also delays the apprehension -- the <i>violent </i>apprehension, I might add -- of non-suspects, as was the case with Horton. It instead expedites the sort of stupidity that would be comical if it weren't so dangerous for everyone involved. The willful ignorance of situations, explained away by the "need" to swiftly apprehend criminals, leads to more death and violence. And not just for "suspects." It makes the situation more dangerous for cops as well. It's as if modern law enforcement agencies view the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war" target="_blank">fog of war</a>" as a tactical advantage, even though nothing about the history of that terms suggests it has ever been viewed that way by actual combatants. <br /><br /> This is an astounding admission. Rhoads, a commanding officer, is willing to purposefully endanger his own officers in the pursuit of a few more busts. His officers, apparently, are more than willing to be abused in this fashion, as long as it means they can dress up in tactical gear and yell a lot while pointing guns at people. Beyond that, though, he's willing to willfully endanger the <i>public </i>by purposefully avoiding any information-gathering that might make these interactions safer for both his officers and those they seek. <br /><br /> Rhoads' statement explains why flashbang grenades get tossed into <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150723/13332731737/officer-indicted-lying-warrant-application-that-led-to-toddler-being-burned-flashbang-grenade.shtml" target="_blank">toddlers' cribs</a>. In the haste to bust someone responsible for $50 worth of drug sales, facts were withheld and investigative reconnaissance of the residence kept to a minimum. It allowed the raiding officers to operate with a minimum of concern for the occupants. All they had to know was "no-knock" and "drug dealer." Everything else was irrelevant. <br /><br /> Deployed troops are put into extremely dangerous situations every day and yet they are expected to maintain relationships with the people in the areas they patrol and not assume every tense situation can only be defused by gunfire. Back in the US where the streets are <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131230/15411225716/number-officers-killed-line-duty-drops-to-50-year-low-while-number-citizens-killed-cops-remains-unchanged.shtml" target="_blank">infinitely safer</a>, the opposite is true. Force and aggression are the favored tactics and an officer's life is valued above all others. This isn't how policing is supposed to work and it betrays the public these officers are supposed to serve. <blockquote> <i>I understood the risks of war when I enlisted as an infantryman. Police officers should understand the risks in their jobs when they enroll in the academy, as well. That means knowing that personal safety can&#8217;t always come first. That is why it&#8217;s service. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s sacrifice.</i> </blockquote> Here in the US, it's the public that's expected to make these sacrifices. A "civilian" is expected to die before an officer does and collateral damage is not only to be expected, it's wholly encouraged by those with the same mentality as Lt. Erik Rhoads. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/05194831784/cop-to-vet-receiving-end-bogus-raid-investigating-things-beforehand-just-slows-us-down.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/05194831784/cop-to-vet-receiving-end-bogus-raid-investigating-things-beforehand-just-slows-us-down.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150729/05194831784/cop-to-vet-receiving-end-bogus-raid-investigating-things-beforehand-just-slows-us-down.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566335574/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488c7586/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/488c7586/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

The evidence was in the form of a 1922 songbook that published the music and lyrics to Happy Birthday, noting that it was via "special permission through courtesy of the Clayton F Summy Co." The Summy company is who registered the copyright in 1935, and which Warner eventually bought. Warner has long argued that there was no pre-1935 publication. As the lawyers for the plaintiffs ("Good Morning To You Productions" -- who are making a documentary film about the song) pointed out, the publishing of the song and lyrics in 1922 <i>without a copyright notice</i> pretty clearly establishes the song is in the public domain. Even if there were a copyright on the original songbook, it would have expired. <br /><br /> It seemed pretty damning, but Warner/Chappell has <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2186441/warner-hbd-oppo.pdf" target="_blank">quickly responded</a> by basically trying to muddy the waters with a "well, who really knows what 'special permission' really meant" line, along with lots of other FUD about how Summy wouldn't have even owned the copyright at that point in the first place. Basically, Warner is just going to claim that none of this matters for as long as it possibly can. Watch the tap dancing: <blockquote><i> Plaintiffs instead assert that it was Summy that authorized the 1922 and 1927 publications. Plaintiffs base this on the one-line statement that The Cable Company included in The Everyday Song Book. But that statement does not say what the “Special permission” was for—was it for Good Morning to All only? Was it for that work in combination with the Happy Birthday lyrics? The statement also does not say when such permission purportedly was provided or any other facts about that would show authorization divesting the Hill Sisters’ copyright. </i></blockquote> Let's see just how much we can confuse everyone by twisting this into knots. The longer we keep up the illusion, the longer people have to pay... so it's worth it... <blockquote><i> Plaintiffs’ evidence does not show the consent of the copyright owner. Plaintiffs argue that, because The Cable Company’s 1922 publication contained the statement, “Special permission through courtesy of The Clayton F. Summy Co.,” the 1922 publication must have had the necessary authorization from the copyright owner to divest the common law copyright. <br /><br /> In 1922, however, the Clayton F. Summy Co. (“Summy”) did not own the copyright to Happy Birthday to You! Summy likewise did not own the copyright to Good Morning to All. In 1922, the copyrighted work Song Stories for the Kindergarten, which contained Good Morning to All, was in its renewal copyright term.... Jessica Hill, who had inherited part of Mildred Hill’s interest in the renewal copyright term of Song Stories for the Kindergarten, timely filed a registration for the renewal term on September 3, 1921.... There is no evidence that the Hill Sisters (Jessica or Patty) granted anyone the right to publish the Happy Birthday to You! lyrics until 1935.

The evidence was in the form of a 1922 songbook that published the music and lyrics to Happy Birthday, noting that it was via "special permission through courtesy of the Clayton F Summy Co." The Summy company is who registered the copyright in 1935, and which Warner eventually bought. Warner has long argued that there was no pre-1935 publication. As the lawyers for the plaintiffs ("Good Morning To You Productions" -- who are making a documentary film about the song) pointed out, the publishing of the song and lyrics in 1922 <i>without a copyright notice</i> pretty clearly establishes the song is in the public domain. Even if there were a copyright on the original songbook, it would have expired. <br /><br /> It seemed pretty damning, but Warner/Chappell has <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2186441/warner-hbd-oppo.pdf" target="_blank">quickly responded</a> by basically trying to muddy the waters with a "well, who really knows what 'special permission' really meant" line, along with lots of other FUD about how Summy wouldn't have even owned the copyright at that point in the first place. Basically, Warner is just going to claim that none of this matters for as long as it possibly can. Watch the tap dancing: <blockquote><i> Plaintiffs instead assert that it was Summy that authorized the 1922 and 1927 publications. Plaintiffs base this on the one-line statement that The Cable Company included in The Everyday Song Book. But that statement does not say what the “Special permission” was for—was it for Good Morning to All only? Was it for that work in combination with the Happy Birthday lyrics? The statement also does not say when such permission purportedly was provided or any other facts about that would show authorization divesting the Hill Sisters’ copyright. </i></blockquote> Let's see just how much we can confuse everyone by twisting this into knots. The longer we keep up the illusion, the longer people have to pay... so it's worth it... <blockquote><i> Plaintiffs’ evidence does not show the consent of the copyright owner. Plaintiffs argue that, because The Cable Company’s 1922 publication contained the statement, “Special permission through courtesy of The Clayton F. Summy Co.,” the 1922 publication must have had the necessary authorization from the copyright owner to divest the common law copyright. <br /><br /> In 1922, however, the Clayton F. Summy Co. (“Summy”) did not own the copyright to Happy Birthday to You! Summy likewise did not own the copyright to Good Morning to All. In 1922, the copyrighted work Song Stories for the Kindergarten, which contained Good Morning to All, was in its renewal copyright term.... Jessica Hill, who had inherited part of Mildred Hill’s interest in the renewal copyright term of Song Stories for the Kindergarten, timely filed a registration for the renewal term on September 3, 1921.... There is no evidence that the Hill Sisters (Jessica or Patty) granted anyone the right to publish the Happy Birthday to You! lyrics until 1935. The evidence instead shows that Summy sought and obtained a license to publish the Happy Birthday to You! lyrics from Jessica Hill in 1935.... Summy would not have had to secure a license from Jessica Hill if it already had the rights to Happy Birthday to You! or if the work had fallen into the public domain. </i></blockquote> This seems like a lot of complexity for the sake of complexity -- just to come up with some sort of argument for why a clearly public domain work might not be in the public domain.

(h/t to Techdirt reader <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/marcanthony">MarcAnthony</a>) <blockquote> <i>According to the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1648158/000119312515262817/d946612ds1.htm" target="_blank">filing</a>, Vizio has sold more than 15 million smart TVs, with about 61 percent of them connected as of the end of June. While viewers are benefiting from those connections, streaming over 3 billion hours of content, Vizio says it's watching them too, with Inscape software embedded in the screens that can track anything you're playing on it -- even if it's from cable TV, videogame systems and streaming devices.</i></blockquote> Here's the potential shareholder-friendly description included in the S-1 filing: <blockquote> <i>Our Inscape data services capture, in real time, up to 100 billion anonymized viewing data points each day from our over 8 million VCUs. Inscape collects, aggregates and stores data regarding most content displayed on VCU television screens, including content from cable and satellite providers, streaming devices and gaming consoles.

What's curious is Vizio's claim that "anonymized data" will result in "more relevant and personalized content" for purchasers. There may be a certain level of anonymity involved, but Vizio still needs to provide enough defining demographic data to make this information worth purchasing. There is some value in general data like number of viewers of specific content at certain times, but Nielsen has done this sort of thing for years and it's a huge stretch to call anything about TV advertising "personal" or "relevant." So, there's something a bit off about the anonymization claims Vizio is making here. <br /><br /> The other issue is that while Vizio is being upfront with regulators about this aspect of its TV offerings, it's not being similarly explicit with purchasers. It is truly the rarest of customers that seeks out a television for its ability to offer "personalized content" in exchange for the sale of his or her viewing data to marketers. <br /><br /> Will users know Vizio is selling their viewing data, including that generated by third-party devices connected to a Vizio smart TV? Probably not. While <a href="https://twitter.com/rjcc/status/624749963604439040" target="_blank">Lawler noted on Twitter</a> than the SEC filing contains 102 mentions of Inscape, the term <a href="http://www.vizio.com/search/?q=inscape&#038;section=support&#038;page=1" target="_blank">fails to surface</a> in searches of Vizio's website. There's also nothing referencing the service in its <a href="http://www.vizio.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.It's not as though this is a feature (which many purchasers would find closer to a bug) still in development. Vizio's own filing indicates this is already in use. While it may be proudly trumpeting its built-in spyware to potential shareholders, it seems a bit more reluctant to inform potential purchasers about the company's thirst for sellable data. <br /><br /> Far too many electronic device manufacturers are unwilling to honestly discuss this part of the business with paying customers, preferring pages and pages of legalese to do the talking for them -- a tactic that allows for both ass-coverage and obfuscation. Vizio does better than some by providing instructions on how to disable this on-by-default "interactivity" early on in its Privacy Policy, but that doesn't necessarily excuse yet another manufacturer that views paying customers as ongoing revenue streams long after they've collected the purchase price for the device. In today's electronics market, it's not enough to simply be a paying customer. You must also be the product as well. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150727/18592631769/vizio-latest-manufacturer-to-offer-more-ways-tvs-to-watch-purchasers.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150727/18592631769/vizio-latest-manufacturer-to-offer-more-ways-tvs-to-watch-purchasers.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150727/18592631769/vizio-latest-manufacturer-to-offer-more-ways-tvs-to-watch-purchasers.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/488b5350/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">

It is truly the rarest of customers that seeks out a television for its ability to offer "personalized content" in exchange for the sale of his or her viewing data to marketers. <br /><br /> Will users know Vizio is selling their viewing data, including that generated by third-party devices connected to a Vizio smart TV? Probably not. While <a href="https://twitter.com/rjcc/status/624749963604439040" target="_blank">Lawler noted on Twitter</a> than the SEC filing contains 102 mentions of Inscape, the term <a href="http://www.vizio.com/search/?q=inscape&#038;section=support&#038;page=1" target="_blank">fails to surface</a> in searches of Vizio's website. There's also nothing referencing the service in its <a href="http://www.vizio.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.It's not as though this is a feature (which many purchasers would find closer to a bug) still in development. Vizio's own filing indicates this is already in use. While it may be proudly trumpeting its built-in spyware to potential shareholders, it seems a bit more reluctant to inform potential purchasers about the company's thirst for sellable data. <br /><br /> Far too many electronic device manufacturers are unwilling to honestly discuss this part of the business with paying customers, preferring pages and pages of legalese to do the talking for them -- a tactic that allows for both ass-coverage and obfuscation. Vizio does better than some by providing instructions on how to disable this on-by-default "interactivity" early on in its Privacy Policy, but that doesn't necessarily excuse yet another manufacturer that views paying customers as ongoing revenue streams long after they've collected the purchase price for the device. In today's electronics market, it's not enough to simply be a paying customer. You must also be the product as well. </p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150727/18592631769/vizio-latest-manufacturer-to-offer-more-ways-tvs-to-watch-purchasers.shtml">Permalink</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150727/18592631769/vizio-latest-manufacturer-to-offer-more-ways-tvs-to-watch-purchasers.shtml#comments">Comments</a> | <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150727/18592631769/vizio-latest-manufacturer-to-offer-more-ways-tvs-to-watch-purchasers.shtml?op=sharethis">Email This Story</a><br /><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/234566349775/u/49/f/661541/c/35345/s/488b5350/sc/28/a2t.img" border="0"/><img width='1' height='1' src='http://techdirt.feedsportal.com/c/35345/f/661541/s/488b5350/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/><div class="feedflare">
