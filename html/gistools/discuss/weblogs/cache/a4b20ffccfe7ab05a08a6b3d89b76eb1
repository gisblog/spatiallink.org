Base data that doesn&rsquo;t change often can now be displayed very quickly while ever changing data could be displayed as overlay markers. </p><p>We&rsquo;ve heard from many of our users that what they really want is the ability to quickly publish maps (2D and 3D) online without a lot of hassle. Google Earth provides a good way to do this because of its ease of use and massive installation base. However, sometimes they just want 2D maps (for aesthetic or licensing issues) that portray their data and get it into their users hands as quickly as possible. </p><p>So what&#39;s needed is a way to&nbsp;publish your map tiles on top of mapping clients. This can be done with several of the mapping APIs including Google Maps, MS Virtual Earth, OpenLayers and the soon to be released ArcGIS Server (albeit at some pretty steep prices). Creation of the tiles is left up to you with the help of some tutorials and in the case of MS, the great <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/mapcruncher/">MapCruncher </a>software. However, these processes use a single image that is subdivided and in the case of 3D clients, resampled to create low resolution versions. A better way is to cut tiles directly out of ArcMap, where the size of the extent is unlimited and the changes in levels produces both excellent resolution and scale depended rendering (e.g. when you zoom in or out, layers can change visibility and symbology). So, to get the best possible set of tiles, you really need to work directly inside ArcMap as opposed to exporting images and then cutting them up. (Note &ndash; the tile cutter geoprocessing tool used for ArcGIS Server uses the optimized route, which is good)</p><p>2D Clients <br />The goal of the <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> publisher is to create tiles and marker overlays easily and publish them to a web server (or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261">Amazon S3</a>) as static files. <strong><em>This avoids server software completely</em></strong>. It won&rsquo;t avoid it for large organizations or people who have extremely dynamic data that cannot be batched, but it does help for the vast majority of users. </p><p>Once the data is created, all the necessary scripts and metadata are created and published along with it. The browser clients created&nbsp;are Google Maps, Virtual Earth and OpenLayers which become immediately available for viewing one the publishing is complete. Below are sample Google and VE maps after publishing a small area of a tax parcel map. The user can opt to export the current map extent or the full extent of a map. (note - this functionality is in the next release of <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> so it is not available for Trial right now)</p><p><img height="398" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/VE_GDIPlus.PNG" style="width:397px;height:398px;" width="397" />&nbsp;</p><p><img height="398" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GMaps_GDIPlus.PNG" style="width:399px;height:398px;" width="399" /></p><p><br />3D Clients<br />Although it&rsquo;s not quite working yet, one of the goals is to automate how the map tiles show up in the 3D clients as well. In the case of Google Earth, KML region data will be written and published along with the tiles. As for VE3D, the map tiles should work right out of the box but unfortunately the critical GetTilePath method currently does not work in the 3D API. I suspect they&rsquo;ll get something working in the future so your tiles will eventually just show up automatically. It could work now if A2E used their built-in tile naming convention, however I think it&rsquo;s more important to support the <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Tile_Map_Service_Specification">OSGEO spec</a> for naming in the long run. I&rsquo;ll have some more on this in the future.</p><p>Marker Symbols<br />Its great to have map tiles of your own data but many times you&rsquo;ll want to click on features to drill down into them. In the wizard, you can specify what point layers you want to have rendered as overlay markers. The regular Arc2Earth InfoWindows settings will govern what is displayed on the popup windows in either GMaps or VE. All of the data and the javascript to integrate it into the web pages will get automatically created and stored with the tiles. no fuss, no muss.</p><p><br />Amazon S3 Web Storage<br />This could be one of the coolest web services out there today. Basically, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261">S3</a> is a huge online storage engine that gives you unlimited capacity based on very reasonable prices for bandwidth and storage. What&rsquo;s even better is the scalability you&rsquo;ll get when using their backend, scalability that would cost you huge amounts of money to do yourself. So, while the default option is to create all of your map tiles and metadata in a local folder, this is a great option for getting your data on the internet without having to worry about servers (or server software for that matter). Arc2Earth takes care of setting up your online &ldquo;buckets&rdquo; and will then do all communications with S3 automatically in the background. It&rsquo;s just a really easy way to get your data online quickly, why have to worry about servers at all?</p><p><img height="387" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/AWS_Publish.PNG" style="width:500px;height:387px;" width="500" /></p><p>Better Drawing Quality<br />ArcMap has tons of cartographic options when determining how you want your maps to appear. When printed, the end result is usually spectacular. However, the onscreen representation can sometimes look a little rough and doesn&rsquo;t really represent what will be displayed on the printed version. The vast majority of people use ArcMap to produce printed maps so this is a good thing although I would have liked them to improve the screen versions of symbols in the shorter term. Long term, the 10.0+ versions should handle this but that doesn&rsquo;t really help us now and since we are using ArcMap to create the map tiles, some improvements are needed. </p><p><img height="387" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/PublishOptions.PNG" style="width:500px;height:387px;" width="500" /></p><p>A first attempt at helping with this problem is to swap out symbols during the export process so that the drawing commands use .Net equivalents with the anti-aliasing support turned on. It&rsquo;s a tricky issue but with the next version of A2E, we&rsquo;ll support simple, cartographic and multi-layered lines. If this option proves to be successful (and actually wanted by the community), we&rsquo;ll add more support for the more esoteric symbols. Personally, I think the map output looks much better and is more in line with what people expect from online map tiles. If you don&rsquo;t like the output and just want the standard ArcMap rendering, simply unckeck the option in the wizard. YMMV.</p><p>Below are sample outputs comparing the standard rendering versus the Arc2Earth rendering.</p><p><img height="397" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GMaps_GDI_2.PNG" style="width:399px;height:397px;" width="399" /></p><p><img height="398" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GMaps_GDIPlus_2.PNG" style="width:398px;height:398px;" width="398" /></p><p>so, the next big release of Arc2Earth will have tons of new features.

It&rsquo;s a tricky issue but with the next version of A2E, we&rsquo;ll support simple, cartographic and multi-layered lines. If this option proves to be successful (and actually wanted by the community), we&rsquo;ll add more support for the more esoteric symbols. Personally, I think the map output looks much better and is more in line with what people expect from online map tiles. If you don&rsquo;t like the output and just want the standard ArcMap rendering, simply unckeck the option in the wizard. YMMV.</p><p>Below are sample outputs comparing the standard rendering versus the Arc2Earth rendering.</p><p><img height="397" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GMaps_GDI_2.PNG" style="width:399px;height:397px;" width="399" /></p><p><img height="398" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GMaps_GDIPlus_2.PNG" style="width:398px;height:398px;" width="398" /></p><p>so, the next big release of Arc2Earth will have tons of new features.

A new Time controller widget on the user interface allows you to control the time period of the globe and data that is tagged with time information will appear or disappear depending on the current time of the map. <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> has several different options for tagging your data automatically, each of which will be covered below. You can download the new version right now, this functionality is available in both the Standard and Pro versions. (if you have Trial version that has not timed out, you can still download and try the latest version!)</p><p>The Time UI in Google is quite functional while at the same time appearing very minimal (something Google seems very good at!). If Time tags are detected inside your file, the Time Line UI will appear automatically on the top of the globe display. The draggable area of the time line consists of a time span (start date and end date) that can be expanded or shrunk itself by dragging its vertical edges. The bottom edge allows you to move the range backwards and forwards through the total time range of your file. The button&nbsp;on the far right toggles the animation that cycles through the time period (optionally loops over and over as well). </p><p><img height="46" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/Timeline.PNG" style="width:295px;height:46px;" width="295" /></p><p><img height="49" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/Timeline_2.PNG" style="width:306px;height:49px;" width="306" /></p><p>The clock button at the far left opens the advanced options for the time period. Personally, I think the default options are the best but feel free to change them as you go.</p><p><img height="157" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/TimelineWindow_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:157px;" width="400" /></p><p><br />Inside Arc2Earth, these new tags are controlled by a new tab that is displayed for each layer in the main &ldquo;Export Entire Map&rdquo; window. There are several options that control how your layer&rsquo;s data is displayed as well as controlling the default time period for the export.</p><p><img height="295" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/LayerTimeWindow_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:295px;" width="400" /></p><p><br />First off, there is a checkbox that controls if Time data is to be added for this layer. The default is that no Time data will be added so you will need to specifically activate this feature for your layers. Multiple layers can have different time options.</p><p>Your layer&rsquo;s date values may come in different flavors. You might have full dates, partial dates or maybe just the year. A2E will look at your data and attempt to convert it automatically giving you the most flexibility with your current data. However, it cannot convert all dates that are stored as strings so you may have to edit your data to get it into the appropriate form. For instance, the value &ldquo;Sep. 20 1863&rdquo; will convert but &ldquo;Sept. 20 1863&rdquo; will not. Single year values like &ldquo;1200&rdquo; or &ldquo;1972&rdquo; will convert automatically.</p><p>Time Resolution &ndash; Your time data may have exact resolution (say down to the second) but maybe you want to display your data to the nearest month, day or year. Use this option to control how the time data is grouped. The default value is &ldquo;Day&rdquo;.</p><p>Single Date/Time &ndash; Use this option to have your data appear when it falls into the current range and then disappear when it falls outside of the current range. </p><p>Date Range &ndash; This option is exactly like single date except you can use multiple fields to set both a start and an end date (e.g. FacilityActiveDate and FacilityInactiveDate). If you leave the End value blank it is assumed to be the present date. This is good for animations where data become visible and stays visible as time goes on.</p><p>Entire Layer &ndash; If you have no dates on your layer but you still want it to use the Time line, you can use this option to apply a single date for the entire layer. For instance, you could have separate tax Parcel layers for different time periods. This option would allow you to chage their visibility based on the current time period.</p><p>Below are sample projects that use the new Time features. The <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/downloads/Toxmaps_Time.kmz">ToxMaps file</a> shows EPA toxic waste sites based on their status date. The <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/downloads/USStates.kmz">US States file</a> shows the states based on the year they entered the union (note &ndash; try changing the time span to a smaller range). The Time functionality in Google Earth creates almost limitless possiblities going forward, I&#39;m excited to see what everyone creates. Also, it may be possible to convert the Animation Manager data in ArcScene and ArcGlobe (coming soon to ArcMap!). While Google&#39;s implementation of time is not true animation, some of the values from the track/keyframe/actions values in&nbsp;the manager&nbsp;might translate well. I&#39;ll keep you posted.</p><p><img height="285" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/ToxMap_1988_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:285px;" width="400" /></p><p><img height="285" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/USStates_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:285px;" width="400" /></p><p>Listening To: The Strokes - Ask Me Anything - First Impressions Of Earth&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/aggbug.aspx?PostID=761" width="1" height="1">";s:7:"summary";s:5839:"<p>Time Support</p><p><a href="http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html">Google Earth 4</a> (version 4.0.2080) now supports adding time information to your data.

(if you have Trial version that has not timed out, you can still download and try the latest version!)</p><p>The Time UI in Google is quite functional while at the same time appearing very minimal (something Google seems very good at!). If Time tags are detected inside your file, the Time Line UI will appear automatically on the top of the globe display. The draggable area of the time line consists of a time span (start date and end date) that can be expanded or shrunk itself by dragging its vertical edges. The bottom edge allows you to move the range backwards and forwards through the total time range of your file. The button&nbsp;on the far right toggles the animation that cycles through the time period (optionally loops over and over as well). </p><p><img height="46" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/Timeline.PNG" style="width:295px;height:46px;" width="295" /></p><p><img height="49" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/Timeline_2.PNG" style="width:306px;height:49px;" width="306" /></p><p>The clock button at the far left opens the advanced options for the time period. Personally, I think the default options are the best but feel free to change them as you go.</p><p><img height="157" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/TimelineWindow_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:157px;" width="400" /></p><p><br />Inside Arc2Earth, these new tags are controlled by a new tab that is displayed for each layer in the main &ldquo;Export Entire Map&rdquo; window. There are several options that control how your layer&rsquo;s data is displayed as well as controlling the default time period for the export.</p><p><img height="295" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/LayerTimeWindow_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:295px;" width="400" /></p><p><br />First off, there is a checkbox that controls if Time data is to be added for this layer. The default is that no Time data will be added so you will need to specifically activate this feature for your layers. Multiple layers can have different time options.</p><p>Your layer&rsquo;s date values may come in different flavors. You might have full dates, partial dates or maybe just the year. A2E will look at your data and attempt to convert it automatically giving you the most flexibility with your current data. However, it cannot convert all dates that are stored as strings so you may have to edit your data to get it into the appropriate form. For instance, the value &ldquo;Sep. 20 1863&rdquo; will convert but &ldquo;Sept. 20 1863&rdquo; will not. Single year values like &ldquo;1200&rdquo; or &ldquo;1972&rdquo; will convert automatically.</p><p>Time Resolution &ndash; Your time data may have exact resolution (say down to the second) but maybe you want to display your data to the nearest month, day or year. Use this option to control how the time data is grouped. The default value is &ldquo;Day&rdquo;.</p><p>Single Date/Time &ndash; Use this option to have your data appear when it falls into the current range and then disappear when it falls outside of the current range. </p><p>Date Range &ndash; This option is exactly like single date except you can use multiple fields to set both a start and an end date (e.g. FacilityActiveDate and FacilityInactiveDate). If you leave the End value blank it is assumed to be the present date. This is good for animations where data become visible and stays visible as time goes on.</p><p>Entire Layer &ndash; If you have no dates on your layer but you still want it to use the Time line, you can use this option to apply a single date for the entire layer. For instance, you could have separate tax Parcel layers for different time periods. This option would allow you to chage their visibility based on the current time period.</p><p>Below are sample projects that use the new Time features. The <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/downloads/Toxmaps_Time.kmz">ToxMaps file</a> shows EPA toxic waste sites based on their status date. The <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/downloads/USStates.kmz">US States file</a> shows the states based on the year they entered the union (note &ndash; try changing the time span to a smaller range). The Time functionality in Google Earth creates almost limitless possiblities going forward, I&#39;m excited to see what everyone creates. Also, it may be possible to convert the Animation Manager data in ArcScene and ArcGlobe (coming soon to ArcMap!). While Google&#39;s implementation of time is not true animation, some of the values from the track/keyframe/actions values in&nbsp;the manager&nbsp;might translate well. I&#39;ll keep you posted.</p><p><img height="285" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/ToxMap_1988_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:285px;" width="400" /></p><p><img height="285" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/USStates_tn.png" style="width:400px;height:285px;" width="400" /></p><p>Listening To: The Strokes - Ask Me Anything - First Impressions Of Earth&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/aggbug.aspx?PostID=761" width="1" height="1">";}i:7;a:10:{s:5:"title";s:24:"New Version of Arc2Earth";s:4:"link";s:101:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2006/08/31/New-Version-of-Arc2Earth.aspx";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 14:16:00 GMT";s:4:"guid";s:40:"53332bb2-7758-437e-86ab-e8e36e8e971d:560";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:5:"admin";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:2:"12";}s:8:"comments";s:70:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/blogs/brian_flood/comments/560.aspx";s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:79:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/blogs/brian_flood/commentrss.aspx?PostID=560";}s:11:"description";s:13499:"<p>A new version of <a href="http://www.Arc2Earth.com" target="_blank">Arc2Earth</a> is currently available for download (<a href="http://www.arc2Earth.com/pricing/default.htm" target="_blank">free Trial version as well</a>).

Well, for non commercial purposes, you can use the data in your projects as long as you reference the data source and the copyright on the map stays intact. In the case of Microsoft, who seems to have the most open policy on using their data, you can optionally arrange for a commercial use license for your entire business (if you have any more questions on this, please contact us).&nbsp; (Update - The links Google data are NOT in the current product)</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;">I suspect the biggest users of this functionality will be smaller shops, educational institutions and non profit organizations.

Likewise, we are also adding support for TerraServer and WorldWind&rsquo;s base tile data in the next version so there will be plenty of free data to choose from. </span></p><p>Here is some more information that I copied from the new A2E Docs, it should give you a better idea of how the new functionality works:</p><p><strong>Map Tile Layer</strong></p><p>A map tile layer is a custom layer that links to raster data that is available over the internet. This data is available as small chunks and needs to be seamed together before it can be displayed in ArcMap. A2E monitors the current map extent and downloads the appropriate tiles to display for that map extent. It also georeferences these tiles so that they appear in ArcMap no matter what Spatial Reference you have set in your map. </p><p><img align="middle" height="57" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/mtl_toolbar.png" style="width:355px;height:57px;" width="355" /></p><p>Toolbar Usage (from left to right)<br />&bull;&nbsp;Turn Layer On/Off &ndash; Adds or removes the custom layer from the active map. There can only be one map tile layer per map<br />&bull;&nbsp;Automatic Refresh &ndash; Turns on the automatic refresh of tiles. When the map extent changes (zooming, panning etc.), the new tiles will be automatically downloaded and displayed<br />&bull;&nbsp;Refresh &ndash; Occasionally, internet problems cause some map tiles not to download properly. These show up as blank areas of the display. Use this command to retry the map tiles.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Map Spec Dropdown &ndash; Changes what map is displayed (streets, aerials, hybrid)<br />&bull;&nbsp;Zoom Level &ndash; Levels 1-20, controls map extent based on the fixed zoom levels that the map tiles were drawn at. Most data starts at level 4 but in the future, higher resolution data may be present at the lower levels<br />&bull;&nbsp;Options &ndash; Opens the Map Tile Layer Option window<br />&bull;&nbsp;Tile Download Status Window &ndash; View what tiles are downloading and repair and failed tiles</p><p><strong>Automatic and Manual Modes</strong><br />There are two options for updating the map tile layer. The default is Automatic, where every change of the map extent triggers the download and display of the new tiles. Additionally, the best map scale will be determined so that the map tiles appear at their optimum quality. </p><p>The second option is Manual mode where the user determines the tiles to download by zooming to an extent and then hitting the Refresh button. The user can also change the Zoom Level to download a higher resolution level then the optimum level for your map extent. This is very helpful when printing and plotting since maps look best with higher resolution raster data (note &ndash; using one level below the optimum level is usually sufficient for quality printing). However, if the map level requested is too low compared to the map extent, the requested number of tiles to display for that level can be very, very high in number. The system will warn you when the number of tiles is greater then 50 however you can override this warning. Downloading and displaying large amounts of tiles at once is not optimal and will likely exhaust local memory and potentially get your IP address banned by the data provider. Use the Manual option with caution!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tile Download Status Window</strong></p><p>Use this window to track what map tiles are downloaded from the internet. Click on each item to view a preview of the image that was downloaded. Right click on an item for a menu that allows you to reload the image if there was an error while downloading.</p><p><img align="middle" height="198" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/downloadStatusWindow_tn.png" style="width:500px;height:198px;" width="500" />&nbsp;</p><p><br /><strong>Renderers<br /></strong>One of the benefits of working with raster data in ArcGIS is the ability to change the display symbology using renderers. Although the Map Tile Layer does not represent a traditional raster datasource, you can still change how it displays in the map using the standard raster symbology. </p><p>Inside the TOC, you will see a Group Layer that represents the custom layer. Open the Properties Window for the contained raster layer to change it symbology. A2E will maintain your symbology even when switching between map types and extents. Below is the aerial layer displayed using True Color, Black and White and a less standard Blue Color ramp.</p><p>&nbsp;<img height="151" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/mtl_TrueColor_tn.png" style="width:200px;height:151px;" width="200" /><img height="151" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/mtl_BlackWhite_tn.png" style="width:200px;height:151px;" width="200" /><img height="151" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/mtl_BlueTint_tn.png" width="200" /></p><p><br /><strong>Map Projections<br /></strong>The map tile layer will be displayed in ArcMap no matter what projection is set for the current map however, some data will only look best from the map projection from which they were originally drawn. All street and hybrid layers contain text data that was drawn in Mercator World projection, therefore if you want the data to not appear fuzzy and distorted inside ArcMap, you will need to change your map frame&rsquo;s projection to World_Mercator. The aerial data is similar but since it lacks cartographic annotations like text and labels, it generally looks good in any projection. Below you can see the distorted image on the left and the correct image on the right.</p><p><img height="164" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/mtl_nonMercProj_tn.png" style="width:200px;height:164px;" width="200" /><img height="165" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/mtl_MercProj_tn.png" style="width:200px;height:165px;" width="200" /></p><p><br />When you first add the map tile layer to your map, A2E will automatically check to see if your map&rsquo;s spatial reference is Mercator. If it is not, the window below will prompt you to change the projection. Feel free to ignore the window and optionally have it not show up again. </p><p><img height="199" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/SR_Dialog_tn.png" style="width:250px;height:199px;" width="250" /></p><p><br /><strong>Hybrid Layers</strong></p><p>Street labels that display over aerial images are a common part of all of the major providers online map offering. This feature is commonly known as &ldquo;Hybrid&rdquo; maps and is available as map tiles in A2E. In the case of Google, Yahoo and Ask.com, the Hybrid layer can be overlaid on your own data. Microsoft&rsquo;s Hybrid layer is actually drawn directly on the image data itself so there is no way to separate it from their aerial data. However, each can be used to enhance your map display with street level information. </p><p><img height="177" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/hybrid_labels_tn.png" style="width:250px;height:177px;" width="250" /></p><p>To view Google, Yahoo&rsquo;s or Ask.com hybrid layers over your own data, right click on the raster layer contained in the group layer to get it&rsquo;s properties window open. Go to the &ldquo;Symbology&rdquo; tab and change the &ldquo;Display Background Values&rdquo; to 255, 255 and 254 respectively. This will turn the background transparent so the labels display over the top of your aerial data.</p><p><br /><strong>Map Tile Cache</strong><br />The map tile cache is an area on your local hard drive where the map tile images are downloaded. Subsequent requests for that tile will use the local copy instead of downloading it again from the internet, increasing the performance of the display. </p><p>From the options window, you can change settings that control when the cache is refreshed. By default, the cache never deletes any data however you can set it to delete files older then a certain amount of days. This will help in situations where hard drive space is an issue. You can also clear the entire cache from the options window as well.</p><p>You can change the base location of the map cache by adding a string value to the &ldquo;Arc2Earth&rdquo; registry key for each user of the machine. The string value should be named &ldquo;CacheBasePath&rdquo; and can include any local or network path that allows the user read/write access. </p><p><br /><strong>Internet Settings</strong><br />A2E must contact internet addresses when downloading the map tiles. In this regard, your Internet Proxy Settings must be set up correctly or no tiles will be downloaded. There is a link to this window on the Help menu and from the Map Tile Options window.</p><p><br /><strong>Options Window</strong></p><p>&nbsp;<img height="256" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/mtl_options_tn.png" style="width:200px;height:256px;" width="200" /></p><p><br /><strong>License</strong><br />The Map Tile Layer functionality may only be used for non-commercial purposes. Any other use must be coordinated with the appropriate map data provider. All imagery obtained using this layer is copyrighted and may not be resold in any form. For more information, please contact: <a href="mailto:sales@arc2earth.com">sales@arc2earth.com</a></p><p><strong>Known Issues<br /></strong>&bull;&nbsp;Copyright and Trial Version text appear multiple times on map exports and plotting<br />&bull;&nbsp;Layer properties for the custom layer crashes. You can change the layer properties for the raster layer contained in the custom layer. This is far more important since this is where you cahnge the symbology, renderers etc.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Previous/Next Map Extent buttons only work if you hit them two times. When in automatic mode, the custom layer will determine the best extent for optimum display of the tiles and will then change the map extent to match this. Most times, this is an extent that is very close to the original so it is not noticed by the end user. However, the automatic change in map extent is recorded in the Previous/Next extent stack tracked by ArcMap. Therefore, the user must hit the buttons twice to navigate to the proper extent.<br />&bull;&nbsp;When the map is not in Mercator_World, the layer does not always repaint correctly when it is unchecked in the TOC.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Using map tile layers in multiple map frames can cause synchronization issues with the toolbar<br />&bull;&nbsp;Slight shifting of imagery when panning around maps</p><p>Listening To: Catch 22 - Sick and Sad - Keasbey Nights</p><img src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/aggbug.aspx?PostID=560" width="1" height="1">";s:7:"summary";s:13499:"<p>A new version of <a href="http://www.Arc2Earth.com" target="_blank">Arc2Earth</a> is currently available for download (<a href="http://www.arc2Earth.com/pricing/default.htm" target="_blank">free Trial version as well</a>).

<P>Textured Surfaces<BR>Displaying images on surfaces in GE seemed like a foregone conclusion to me, there was no way this portion of functionality from SketchUp was going to be left out. That being said, I really like how they implemented this by using a standard format like Collada. Originally developed by Sony to (presumably) facilitate transfer of rich models from standard 3D modeling packages into PlayStation3, the format is now open sourced but controlled by <A href="http://www.khronos.org/">Khronos</A>. The format itself is quite rich and contains much more information then GE4 actually uses (pixel shaders, physics engine support, animation etc.) but I would be willing to bet future versions of GE will take more advantage of these features. Below is example of using a (very) simple model primarily as a display of image data, previously you could only&nbsp;create a ground overlay or display the image in a Placemark’s description window. Now we can pin the image to any surface in the&nbsp;scene.&nbsp;In the case below, we are duplicating the digital billboards in NYC’s Time Square. The image shows a realtime chart of stock information that updates using the refresh parameters of the new “Link” tag (this is still flakey). The image resampling and positioning can be controlled in the Collada file so with some more work, the quality of the display should improve.</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_1.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_1_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_2.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_2_tn.png"></IMG></A> 
<P><BR>“Real” models<BR>This goes hand and hand with texture support, GE4 now supports the concept of a&nbsp;“shared model”, something that has been sorely missed in the past versions. A shared model is a complex set of geometry and materials that are loaded once by the program and then translated/rotated/scaled at runtime (usually with the help of hardware T&amp;L). So, instead of overloading the memory with lots of similar models, GE4 will now use a single chunk of memory and quickly reproject it during its display. This mostly helps scenes that share identical models (trees, signs, cars etc.) however it not as helpful when all the models are distinct (like with buildings). We’ll see how this functionality progresses in the future, it still seems a little flakey to me (at least at v 4.0.1563). Below is a fairly large stand of trees, previously this would created a KMZ file that was&nbsp;quite large&nbsp;since each model was exported as individual KML primitives. Now, it will both download and load very quickly. Couple this functionality with Regions and you have a very powerful means to display large scenes of (possibly changing) data.</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_3.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_3_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_2.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_2_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_1.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_1_tn.png"></IMG></A> 
<P>Regions<BR>This could be the hidden jewel of the new 2.1 spec. While textured surfaces are getting all the attention, the real challenge in the past has been loading large amounts of data into GE (be it polygons, ground overlays or the pseudo models). Regions solve all of this by allowing the KML developer to tell GE when and where to display data. GE currently does this with its built-in layers like “Buildings” or “Roads”. As the user zooms in, more detailed data is turned on. This is usually done by continually subdividing the extent of data until a sufficient minimum resolution is reached. GE will then “activate” these regions based on the location of the camera. When a region is active, the placemarks and models inside will be visible. You can also specify a fading effect for the placemarks as they come close changing their visibility, this simply provides a more visually appealing transition but it also can help eliminate “popping” when your region loads more complex data then its predecessor (e.g. using a simple polygon for an area of trees and then showing actual trees when you get closer (see the tree example above). </P>

<P>KML Updates<BR>Again, this is another hidden jewel in GE4. Previously, as NetworkLinks loaded more data, they completely cleared out their child hierarchies. This was dynamic but wasteful since many times the data that it contained was still valid. To get around this “all or nothing” approach to volatile data, GE now supports an “Update” tag that essentially contains Add/Edit/Delete operators that rely on Placemarks containing unique IDs (get ready to see <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID">GUIDs</A> on everything now). GE will then apply these changes to the existing data that is loaded (possible from the local cache). This has the possibility of dramatically lowering network traffic for large KML files.</P>
<P>Another cool aspect of Updates is the optional use of the HTTP headers to determine the “freshness” of data. This is a quick way to version datasets and is the clearest indicator of Google Earth becoming a geospatial browser of sorts. </P>
<P>More to come on the KML 2.1 front and I'll soon post several examples of the concepts talked about above.</P>

<P>Textured Surfaces<BR>Displaying images on surfaces in GE seemed like a foregone conclusion to me, there was no way this portion of functionality from SketchUp was going to be left out. That being said, I really like how they implemented this by using a standard format like Collada. Originally developed by Sony to (presumably) facilitate transfer of rich models from standard 3D modeling packages into PlayStation3, the format is now open sourced but controlled by <A href="http://www.khronos.org/">Khronos</A>. The format itself is quite rich and contains much more information then GE4 actually uses (pixel shaders, physics engine support, animation etc.) but I would be willing to bet future versions of GE will take more advantage of these features. Below is example of using a (very) simple model primarily as a display of image data, previously you could only&nbsp;create a ground overlay or display the image in a Placemark’s description window. Now we can pin the image to any surface in the&nbsp;scene.&nbsp;In the case below, we are duplicating the digital billboards in NYC’s Time Square. The image shows a realtime chart of stock information that updates using the refresh parameters of the new “Link” tag (this is still flakey). The image resampling and positioning can be controlled in the Collada file so with some more work, the quality of the display should improve.</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_1.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_1_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_2.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_TimesSquare_2_tn.png"></IMG></A> 
<P><BR>“Real” models<BR>This goes hand and hand with texture support, GE4 now supports the concept of a&nbsp;“shared model”, something that has been sorely missed in the past versions. A shared model is a complex set of geometry and materials that are loaded once by the program and then translated/rotated/scaled at runtime (usually with the help of hardware T&amp;L). So, instead of overloading the memory with lots of similar models, GE4 will now use a single chunk of memory and quickly reproject it during its display. This mostly helps scenes that share identical models (trees, signs, cars etc.) however it not as helpful when all the models are distinct (like with buildings). We’ll see how this functionality progresses in the future, it still seems a little flakey to me (at least at v 4.0.1563). Below is a fairly large stand of trees, previously this would created a KMZ file that was&nbsp;quite large&nbsp;since each model was exported as individual KML primitives. Now, it will both download and load very quickly. Couple this functionality with Regions and you have a very powerful means to display large scenes of (possibly changing) data.</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_3.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_3_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_2.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_2_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_1.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/GE4_Trees_1_tn.png"></IMG></A> 
<P>Regions<BR>This could be the hidden jewel of the new 2.1 spec. While textured surfaces are getting all the attention, the real challenge in the past has been loading large amounts of data into GE (be it polygons, ground overlays or the pseudo models). Regions solve all of this by allowing the KML developer to tell GE when and where to display data. GE currently does this with its built-in layers like “Buildings” or “Roads”. As the user zooms in, more detailed data is turned on. This is usually done by continually subdividing the extent of data until a sufficient minimum resolution is reached. GE will then “activate” these regions based on the location of the camera. When a region is active, the placemarks and models inside will be visible. You can also specify a fading effect for the placemarks as they come close changing their visibility, this simply provides a more visually appealing transition but it also can help eliminate “popping” when your region loads more complex data then its predecessor (e.g. using a simple polygon for an area of trees and then showing actual trees when you get closer (see the tree example above). </P>

<P>KML Updates<BR>Again, this is another hidden jewel in GE4. Previously, as NetworkLinks loaded more data, they completely cleared out their child hierarchies. This was dynamic but wasteful since many times the data that it contained was still valid. To get around this “all or nothing” approach to volatile data, GE now supports an “Update” tag that essentially contains Add/Edit/Delete operators that rely on Placemarks containing unique IDs (get ready to see <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID">GUIDs</A> on everything now). GE will then apply these changes to the existing data that is loaded (possible from the local cache). This has the possibility of dramatically lowering network traffic for large KML files.</P>
<P>Another cool aspect of Updates is the optional use of the HTTP headers to determine the “freshness” of data. This is a quick way to version datasets and is the clearest indicator of Google Earth becoming a geospatial browser of sorts. </P>
<P>More to come on the KML 2.1 front and I'll soon post several examples of the concepts talked about above.</P>

<P>I’ve been holding off on explaining the 3D exporting capabilities because of some issues when importing MultiPatch data in ArcGIS. Given the announcement of <A href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse">Google’s 3D Warehouse </A>last week, I’m really glad I did. The warehouse is great place for people to store and share models they create with <A href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</A>. <A href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</A> is an amazing tool for creating both models and Google (in true Google form) provided a free&nbsp;version of the product. There are great options for placing these models inside Google Earth directly however, if the geographical extent of your area of interest is too large, placing multiple models is tedious. This is where <A href="http://www.arc2earth.com/">Arc2Earth</A> can help out in situations where you want to “apply” the model to existing coordinates in your spatial data. For example, instead of using marker symbols for water tanks across region, you could apply a 3D Model to each tank’s location. A2E will translate (and optionally scale and rotate) the model’s coordinates automatically for you. The resulting KMZ file is larger of course but when applied judiciously, the resulting 3D scenes can be more compelling. Just don’t try exporting the Empire State Building model across thousands of points :)</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_3.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_3_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_5.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_5_tn.png"></IMG></A> 
<P>To make it easy to get models, A2E includes forms that are similar to SketchUp’s when interacting with the warehouse. You can browse or search for models using Google’s existing web pages and A2E will provide additional UI elements for the download. It will then automatically download the file and prepare it for export. A current limitation is the model files must be in KMZ format however a future version of A2E could have the ability to read SketchUp files directly. All in all, it is easy to get models and export them into your scene.</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Options.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Options_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_2.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_2_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_3.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_3_tn.png"></IMG></A>

However, ArcGIS is full of great tools to visualize your data based on their attributes. Going back to our Water Tank example, maybe you want to shows all tanks with a large capacity in a different color then the rest of the tanks? This is easily done in ArcGIS using a suitable renderer. A2E can use this information to “re-style” the model in part or in whole. In this regard, the models become more dynamic since they can be styled to display all different sorts of data. Likewise, the models can be scaled and rotated by fixed or attribute defined values. So style, size, orientation and clearly location are all dynamically applied during the export.</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_6.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_Warehouse_6_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_4.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_4_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_1.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_1_tn.png"></IMG></A><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/3DModel_ReStyle.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/3DModel_ReStyle_tn.png"></IMG></A>

For the most part, all I needed to do was revise the way PictureMarkerSymbols were exported and voila, that would be it. A2E could always export ground overlay rasters in GE, so you should be able to get similar results directly from ArcMap. So no problem right, how hard could it be? As always, harder then I thought…</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/PM_1.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/PM_1_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/PM_3.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/PM_3_tn.png"></IMG></A> 
<P>First off, I had not used ArcMap’s Picture Symbol editor in quite awhile and I was quickly reacquainted with a major oversight in the UI. The underlying ArcObjects API allows you to assign any IPicture in memory to the PictureMarkerSymbol. I assumed with this functionality as part of the framework, the UI would certainly allow you choose from the wide assortment of images that most people are familiar with (e.g. GIF, PNG, JPG etc.). However, the file selector window only allows you to choose BMP or EMF. Hmmm, why would they intentionally leave off the other image formats? There are plenty of images in these formats and 2 of them already support transparency directly. Ultimately the answer may lie with the performance of ArcMap once you use an image of anything greater then 16x16 in size, it’s abysmal. Perhaps this is why they left it out in the first place…</P>
<P>However, this omission was now standing in the way of a clean A2E export using the more compelling image formats [2]. I could have just rigged up another option but it would branch from the notion that all symbology is created from with ArcMap. Also, all of the renderers are tied directly to the existing symbology model. What if an A2E user wanted to export markers with different symbols based on some attribute field? This was too common of an occurrence to just ignore the problem and rig up an alternate UI that would ultimately just confuse the end user. </P>
<P>Thankfully, ArcMap is built in such a way that you can alter the user interface via a set of components called Property Pages. A Property Page is a runtime customization that, in the case of ArcMap, uses registry categories to determine what UI piece to show for each component in the system. Normally, you would need to recompile the application or bolt-on your own window over the top of existing windows. PPs allow you to integrate seamlessly with the existing windows. This is nothing new, Microsoft has promoted this type of customization for quite awhile however, ESRI really should get credit for building a framework that takes this process to heart. </P>

For the most part, all I needed to do was revise the way PictureMarkerSymbols were exported and voila, that would be it. A2E could always export ground overlay rasters in GE, so you should be able to get similar results directly from ArcMap. So no problem right, how hard could it be? As always, harder then I thought…</P><a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/PM_1.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/PM_1_tn.png"></IMG></A> <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/PM_3.png"><IMG src="/sdl/public/images/PM_3_tn.png"></IMG></A> 
<P>First off, I had not used ArcMap’s Picture Symbol editor in quite awhile and I was quickly reacquainted with a major oversight in the UI. The underlying ArcObjects API allows you to assign any IPicture in memory to the PictureMarkerSymbol. I assumed with this functionality as part of the framework, the UI would certainly allow you choose from the wide assortment of images that most people are familiar with (e.g. GIF, PNG, JPG etc.). However, the file selector window only allows you to choose BMP or EMF. Hmmm, why would they intentionally leave off the other image formats? There are plenty of images in these formats and 2 of them already support transparency directly. Ultimately the answer may lie with the performance of ArcMap once you use an image of anything greater then 16x16 in size, it’s abysmal. Perhaps this is why they left it out in the first place…</P>
<P>However, this omission was now standing in the way of a clean A2E export using the more compelling image formats [2]. I could have just rigged up another option but it would branch from the notion that all symbology is created from with ArcMap. Also, all of the renderers are tied directly to the existing symbology model. What if an A2E user wanted to export markers with different symbols based on some attribute field? This was too common of an occurrence to just ignore the problem and rig up an alternate UI that would ultimately just confuse the end user. </P>
<P>Thankfully, ArcMap is built in such a way that you can alter the user interface via a set of components called Property Pages. A Property Page is a runtime customization that, in the case of ArcMap, uses registry categories to determine what UI piece to show for each component in the system. Normally, you would need to recompile the application or bolt-on your own window over the top of existing windows. PPs allow you to integrate seamlessly with the existing windows. This is nothing new, Microsoft has promoted this type of customization for quite awhile however, ESRI really should get credit for building a framework that takes this process to heart. </P>

<P>The usage analysis was done to qualify sewer meter flow in the system.

The usage data was linked to the building footprints by customer address and we were able to link up 99% of the records (Some records were missing in the case of the strip mall).

<P>The hydraulic analysis was done to model the most efficient water system for the proposed site while adhering to pressure and fire requirements. The plan represented in the KML is the initial planned system for the proposed development within the existing system. The model was created using Haestad Methods WaterCad from plans of the existing system and site plans of the proposed development.&nbsp; WaterCad allows you to export the points and lines representing the junctions and mains and also synchronize those shapefiles with whatever scenario of the model you are working with. The junctions were exported for each scenario; Base has no strain on the system while fire adds a 1000 gpm fire demand at the highest point of the proposed site. ESRI 3DAnalyst was used to create a TIN from the junctions (points) HGL (Hydraulic Grade Line) for both the Base and the Fire scenarios. These TINs were then represented as a gradated raster and line framework and extruded by their z values. The junctions where also extruded to their HGL value (Base = Blue, Fire = Red).</P>
<LI>Layers – Layers can clicked and will show a brief description of the kmz file 
<LI>Legend – Shows a legend of the layers in the file 
<LI>Graphics – Several labels showing street names, some building addresses and the location of the fire demand 
<LI>Base – This TIN represents the HGL (Hydraulic Grade Line) of the system with a full tank and 1.5 time average day demands. Losses are minimal during normal operation as seen by the solid color of the TIN. 
<LI>Fire – This TIN represents the HGL of the system at the beginning of a 1000 gpm fire. The system becomes depressed due to the large amount of water being taken out of the system. This depression is more pronounced on the proposed site as seen by the gradation of the colors in the TIN. 
<LI>Base – Line – These green lines represent the actual borders of the triangles that are created for the Base TIN. It is another graphical representation of the information in the Base TIN. 
<LI>Fire – Line – These orange lines represent the actual borders of the triangles that are created for the Fire TIN. It is another graphical representation of the information in the Fire TIN. 
<LI>Residential Usage – This layer represents the usage of the units for the average daily demand for the period of December to March in 2005. The information was attached to the building footprint by address. A color ramp of green (low) to red (high) was used to allow an easy overview of the usage data. Each unit also holds information including address, customer name, and average usage for each individual month. The building footprints were extruded to an estimated building height. 
<LI>Commercial Usage – Due to the large difference in values between residential users and commercial users a separate color ramp was developed. This color ramp of light blue (low usage) to pink (high usage) uses the same information as listed above in the Residential Usage layer. 
<LI>Water Main – This layer represents the water mains in the system, both existing and proposed. They are color coded by the diameter of the main. 
<LI>Storage Tank – This represents the storage tank in the system, it is extruded to height of the overflow (1058 ft MSL) 
<LI>Junction_Fire – These are the junction nodes used in the water system model and hold information such as demand at that node, elevation, pressure and HGL of the junction. These points are what where used to create the TINs noted above, as seen by the Fire-Line layer lines originating at all these points. This layer represents the junction under the fire scenario created in the water model. It is extruded to the height of the HGL at that node this is seen as the red part of the of the column. 
<LI>Junction_Base – This is the same as the Junction Fire layer but represent the nodes HGL under base conditions. It is seen as the blue column on top of the red column.
