<p>In this week's episode, I sit down with <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryYokoBrannen">Mary Yoko Brannen</a>, the president and CEO of CLIA Consulting, the Jarislowsky East Asia (Japan) chair at the Centre for Asia Pacific Initiatives, and a professor of international business and research director at the University of Victoria Gustavson School of Business.
</p>
<p>Brannen is an expert in ethnomethodology and qualitative studies of complex cultural organizational phenomena. She spends a lot of time focused on how changing cultural contexts affect technology and how to leverage cultural identity in the global workplace. We unpack all that in this episode and talk about how her proposed "ethnographic thinking" approach can address language and culture gaps in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights from our chat:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm an organizational anthropologist. What does that mean? It means that, like anthropologists study far-away tribes, I study organizations as if they were tribes. I'm interested in organizational culture, and how organizational culture combines with national cultural differences, as well as occupational cultural differences, and how people can integrate those and work together.
</p></blockquote>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>Ethnographic thinking may sound a little bit like another buzz word, like 'design thinking,' but the difference is that, first of all, if you just take the word 'ethnograph.' 'Ethno' means people. 'Graph' is documenting. It's really documenting the day-to-day life of people. You do so by observing what the people that you're interested in as an organization do. ... You document, for example, how the user lives with the product or the service that you're engaged in making. Rather than pushing a product onto the consumer, you think about, 'Okay. How is the consumer going to engage with the product?' You do much more of a deep dive into the day-to-day life. Then, you would design whatever your service or your product is to fit in with the everyday life of the consumer. Going much deeper into understanding their context.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I work a lot with mergers and acquisitions, and integrating cultures &mdash; different national cultures as well as organizational cultures. I guess, the most important advise that I would have is that culture is a really big thing. I like to use an acronym for culture which kind of helps people understand the severity of changing it. I see culture as a HELP system: Habits, Expectations, Language, and Perceptions. Different cultures have different HELP systems. When you're talking about changing a culture, you're talking about changing the person's HELP system. It's a big deal.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I think there's a really big change [in the corporate landscape]. First of all, I think that the dominance of the West is no longer the case. We're shifting from the West to the East in terms of transferring knowledge, to the East to the West and South to North more. That's a very big change. When we talk about Latin America, when we talk about Asia, we're talking about collectivist societies. Societies that are very, very different than our own in the West. Societies where people think more about group, and have different ways in which they manage groups. They don't think about self-actualization as the pinnacle on Maslow's Needs Hierarchy. Managing and collaborating with people that, again, have a very, very different HELP system is extremely important. At the same time, English as a lingua franca is not going to be around for much longer. We're going to have multilingual organizations, where sidebars in Chinese, sidebars in Spanish are going to be much more of the norm.

<p>In this week's Design Podcast episode, I sit down with <a href="https://twitter.com/brownorama">Dan Brown</a>, designer at Eightshapes and author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Together-collaboration-management-professionals/dp/0321918630">Designing Together</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321712463">Communicating Design</a></em>. Brown is speaking at <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/design-ux-interaction-iot?intcmp=il-design-confreg-lp-dsca16_20151111_radar_dan_brown_design_podcast_post_conf_link">OReilly's inaugural Design Conference</a>, January 20-22, 2016, in San Francisco.</p>
<p>We talk about managing fixed and growth mindsets, embracing impostor syndrome, and the most important skill for all designers (hint: it's not empathy).</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Carol Dweck wrote a book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-New-Psychology-Success/dp/0345472322">Mindset</a></em>, which talks about the studies that she'd been doing over the years about attitude, and specifically her attitude toward challenge.The studies show that if someone has been called 'smart' all their lives, they are actually more reluctant to take on a challenge because they believe that if they fail at the challenge, they will sort of undermine their own self-identity. This is what she calls the 'fixed mindset,' the sort of inherent belief that I am who I am, and nothing that I do will change that.</p>
<p>The converse, which she noticed in doing the studies, is a 'growth mindset.' These are people who embrace a challenge because they understand that that's part of the learning process, and maybe they'll get frustrated, but they won't shy away from it all together.</p></blockquote>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>When people ask me what's the most important skill to cultivate as a designer, I think it's self-awareness.We talk a lot about empathy. We talk a lot about putting yourself in the user's shoes or in your colleague's shoes. I think that's really important. I like working with designers who understand what's going to be hard for them because when they know that, they can ask for help &mdash; they're good at saying, 'You know what? Visual design is not my forte, so I'll take a crack at it, but I'm really going to need some help making sure I get it right,' or 'I know that front end development is not what you hired me to do, but I'd like to take a stab at it, and I know I'm going to need some mentoring in that area.' All those kinds of messages are enormously helpful for me as a lead, but also for the designer themselves to have an understanding of where they thrive and where the opportunities are for growth.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Impostor syndrome is the idea that even someone like me, 20 years into my career, still thinks, 'What am I doing here? Why are people listening to me?' Even for someone who's now decades into a career, the notion that maybe I shouldn't be here persists. I realized that I just need to be okay with that because part of being a designer is constantly doubting yourself. It sort of comes with the territory. <a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do-c47d4d470533">That's the advice that I wrote in that particular article</a> &mdash; being a designer means looking at your work and going, 'This could be better; this could be better.' You're almost constantly saying that to yourself. I think the hard part for designers is to look at that not as an excuse to stop, but as an excuse to keep going.</p>
<p>You can go too far in the other direction; you can get into the sort of analysis paralysis, where you're constantly churning on something because it's not perfect. I guess perfectionism and impostor syndrome are really two sides of the same coin. But there is a balance, I think, that designers seek, which is, 'I understand that I need to be skeptical of the work that I do because it's through that skepticism that I experienced discomfort and challenge myself to do better.' At the same time, they need to acknowledge that it's not just them, that everyone is sort of experiencing that because that's the nature of design.</p></blockquote>

"No one ever turns off JavaScript any more."  I remember when I first believed that, probably around 2007.  The growth of Ajax had meant that more people were actually losing content if they turned off JavaScript. From what I could tell, most of the few folks still blocking JavaScript surrendered pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I don't believe that any more, though, thanks to advertising and the doors that blocking advertising has opened.</p>
<p>While a key part of the last decade's Web conversation has been performance, the walled gardens are taking advantage of our failure to deliver performance to make their own promises.  Facebook's <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/">Instant Articles</a> offer a way for publishers to use the (relative) certainty of Facebook delivery, while Apple took a more direct route for demanding performance: blocking advertisements, and more.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2015/09/18/ad-blocking-and-the-future-of-the-web/">Adpocalypse</a> arrived in September. As the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html">New York Times noticed, ads eat bandwidth</a>. Advertising traffic will likely decline somewhere between 4% and 11% as users of iOS devices turn on blockers, but the story doesn't stop there.   Apple's approach offers much more than ad blocking.  On a platform where Apple makes money on apps, Apple offers its users the power to turn off much of the Web: <a href="https://www.webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/">fonts, styles, scripts, and more</a>.  </p>
<p>Forcing the Web to its most basic settings actually works pretty well in a context - like iOS - where "there's an app for that" but broad search is still sometimes useful.  Bandwidth costs money, and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/06/app-thinning-will-be-a-major-boon-for-8gb-and-16gb-iphones-and-ipads/">on-demand app resources may also be hungry</a>.  A deliberately minimal Web experience makes sense given those constraints, at least for customers with app-centric priorities.  (It clearly helps Apple make the case for both apps and app development.)</p>
<p>For the rest of us, especially those of us who had been using the Web to walk around the walled gardens of the app world, blocking creates new problems beyond a sudden reduction in ad revenue.  For the first time in a decade, we have to worry about development challenges much larger than "why are my visitors still using IE?"  We are suddenly back in a world where a substantial number of visitors use the Web in its most basic form.</p>
<p>The future of web development depends on how many of those visitors decide to minimize their web experience.  In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are JavaScript-driven sites so ubiquitous now that iOS users will want to keep that part of the Web activated?  (My guess is yes, but it's a tentative yes.)</li>
<li>Do web fonts makes sites so much more attractive that users' eyes will ache if they're turned off?  (Perhaps not.)</li>
<li>Have developers scrambled source order so badly that sites will be unintelligible without CSS?  (Maybe, though that would be a lousy way to protect the Web.)  Enough sites still have CSS that doesn't work well in a mobile context that turning off CSS on a mobile device isn't always a loss.</li>
<li>Are graphics that important to the Web? (I bet cat pictures are important.)
</ul>
<p>Turning off web fonts, CSS, and images will frustrate designers and limit user interface possibilities, but turning off JavaScript might mean that we have to reconsider the architecture of our applications.  Without JavaScript, the Web returns to its foundations of HTTP requests returning pages, with links and form submissions as the backbone of application structure.</p>
<p>While I <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">dream of progressive apps</a>, this more restricted world means that we need to spend some time with <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a> first.  For apps that expect regular communication with the server without page refreshes - most of them do - it's probably time to learn about <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/">isomorphic</a> (or <a href="http://blog.getify.com/adaptive-hybrid-javascript/">adaptive hybrid, or middle end</a>) JavaScript and make sure that your sites can function in a minimal environment.  (Developers thought <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/05/its-the-end-of-the-web-as-we-knew-it.html">Google freed them of some of this obligation last year</a>, but the freedom Google giveth, Apple (users) taketh away.</p>
<p>Crazy talk, isn't it?  A year ago I could not have imagined a small but potentially influential group of people turning off much of the Web.  On the bright side, it reopens <a href="https://medium.com/@humphd/402-payment-required-95bc72f06fcd">lost conversations about payment models on the Web</a>, and maybe it will give the Web some breathing space to contemplate simpler models.</p>

<p>Picture a modern web application. It almost certainly uses interactive controls, perhaps a carousel at the start, probably a set of tabs or an accordion, or maybe it is based on a coverflow or deck. These are common user interface metaphors: if you use these terms, designers know what you mean, and people recognize and know how to use them. At first glance these design patterns seem to have quite different characteristics, but  we'd like to convince you that they really aren't so different after all.</p>
<h2>Ok, convince me!</h2>
<p>The idea of a panel of content comes from the printing industry. In printing, a panel is a single page of a brochure, or one face of a folded leaflet. A print panel might be visually unique, like the cover of a leaflet, or be like other panels in a set, like the inner faces of the leaflet.</p>
<p>The concept of a panel has been applied to web design multiple times, generally becoming interactive along the way. Panels of content can be expanded or collapsed, removed completely, or presented in collections. Each of these design patterns has a common purpose: display a collection or set of things, generally one at a time to save on screen space. They may cycle vertically or horizontally, or peel off in layers, but these transition effects do not change the fundamental purpose of the thing - to navigate effectively through some pieces of content.</p>
<p> <!--more--></p>
<p>We can see the relationship between these design patterns even more clearly when we think about accessibility. ARIA 1.0 gives us a way to mark up a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel">set of tabs</a>, and explains that the same markup can be used for an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion">accordion</a> as well. For responsive design, this equivalence becomes a real asset. A carousel of images with 3D effects on a desktop wide screen can be presented as a deck of small images on a phone touch screen.</p>
<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>Thomas Edison said that genius was 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. As a prolific genius, we can probably take his word for it. On the web it is certainly true. But there is a problem.</p>
<p>When we invent something new, we have to build it. Then thousands of developers write code to do much the same thing, except with slight variations and changes. This is how we innovate and design patterns emerge. But when the task has become routine (like implementing a tab set or carousel), the inconsistencies bother users and it creates more work. Libraries have helped reduce the rate at which we reinvent the wheel, but there are many libraries each with their own inadvertent and deliberate differences. As well as compatibility headaches for developers trying to choose a set of tools, these differences mean that people can never quite be sure how something will work.</p>
<p>When we get to this point on the web it is useful to have a common standard: a consistent way to create these patterns, with consistent interactions that people are familiar with. It is true that browsers implement standards in subtly different ways, but whereas people might use many different websites or applications during the course of a day, they will only change browsers once or twice (between their smart phone and a laptop for example). A common standard doesn't solve all the problems, but it does make things easier for both developers and users.</p>
<h2>So what's the idea?</h2>
<p>In late 2014, Brian Kardell, Steve Faulkner, Chaals McCathie Nevile and I were chatting at TPAC. Brian had been thinking for some time about the fact that tab sets, carousels, accordions and so on are just different ways of presenting the same thing. In the weeks that followed, we started to identify use cases and requirements. We wanted a simpler way to work with these design patterns, switching between them for responsive design, and minimizing the code that needed to be written. We wanted to benefit from reduced code errors, and improved performance.</p>
<p>In usability terms we wanted to identify the common features of these design patterns so interaction could be more consistent. We also wanted something that could be dependably used by people using a setup the developer didn't anticipate, like a screen reader or a custom keyboard and no mouse.</p>
<p>The result of our conversation is a proposal for some standard HTML that declares things as <code>&lt;panels&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;panelsets&gt;</code>, with a consistent set of DOM APIs. The <a href="https://specs.webplatform.org/common-panel/bkardell/gh-pages/">proposed elements and attributes</a> enable developers to describe the content to be presented, and separately choose the visual metaphor to be used. This separation makes it possible to switch between visual representations without changing the underlying structure or interaction, making things simpler for responsive design and more consistent for users.</p>
<p>It isn't hard to write a specification, but it is hard to convince browser vendors to implement the proposal without a lot of theoretical discussion. It is easy to get things wrong at the proposal stage. In the real world developers might use things in unpredictable ways that cause problems, or the proposal  might turn out not to meet the needs of most of the expected users. For example an early attempt at a standard way to use panels on the web was the HTML <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> element, which has now been almost entirely abandoned because they brought new unanticipated problems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because agreeing on a standard and getting it implemented in browsers can take a long time, proposals are of little value to developers. It's hard to comment on something until you've used it, and by the time it's possible to use it it's usually too late. To address this, Brian made <a href="https://bkardell.github.io/common-panel/prototype/panelset-element.html">prollyfill implementations</a>, both as custom element definitions and Angular directives. Prollyfills are experimental implementations of proposed standards, and the hope is that developers will be able to use these implementations to provide useful feedback. If the proposal becomes a standard that is supported natively in browsers, the prollyfill can be reworked into a polyfill for browsers that don't yet support it.</p>
<h2>So, what's the markup?</h2>
<p>The basic model is a <code>&lt;panel&gt;</code> element, which is a container like <code>div</code>. Each panel should have a <code>&lt;paneltitle&gt;</code>, because even if it is not shown in some renderings, it will be useful for example to a screen reader user who cannot visually identify the panel.</p>
<p>[crayon-56473585c4c81494026066/]</p>
<p>Multiple <code>panel</code> elements can be grouped together in a <code>panelset</code> element. This follows the convention for creating collections by placing child elements inside a parent container. This should help ensure developers find it intuitive, preventing simple mistakes.</p>
<p>[crayon-56473585c4c96701818707/]</p>
<p>To make a removable panel, the <code>panel</code> element can have a <code>removable</code> attribute. This gives the panel a button that can be used to remove the panel from the DOM.</p>
<p>[crayon-56473585c4c9f379404564/]</p>
<p>A panel can also have the <code>expandable</code> attribute applied. At present this indicates that a single panel is expanded, and if the panel is part of a panel set then all other panels in the set are collapsed. This feature is still under discussion because there is a use case for multiple panels to be expanded simultaneously, such as in an accordion.</p>
<p>You may have noted that a single expandable panel and its title seem to do the same thing as the proposal for <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>, which did not have broad enough browser support to be included for HTML5 but is likely to be in a future version of HTML. If the panels proposal is accepted the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements could be considered a special case, or deprecated in favor of &lt;panel&gt; and &lt;paneltitle&gt;. We'll only learn what happens as the future unfolds.</p>
<p>Finally there is the question of how to display a set of panels. A set of CSS pseudo-elements make it possible to provide different visual representations of the panelset</. The <code>preferreddisplay</code> attribute enables developers to request a chosen visual metaphor that can be overridden by the browser. At the same time developers can use CSS media queries to switch the <code>preferreddisplay</code> attribute value at certain breakpoints, triggering proper responsive styling.</p>
<p>[crayon-56473585c4ca8289125134/]</p>
<h2>So what happens now?</h2>
<p>This is where you come in. We've put together a proposed specification, and we've tried to think of all of the angles. There are just four of us though, and there's no way we'll have covered everything. Even if we could, four people do not make a standard!</p>
<p>We need a lot of people to take a look at our proposal and kick its tires. Better still, we need developers and browser vendors to use the prollyfill prototypes, and let us know what works and what doesn't. Above all we need everyone to ask questions and <a href="https://github.com/bkardell/common-panel/issues">file issues</a> for discussion, so we can get the specification to a viable state for implementation.</p>

<p>Irizarry also talks about the best ways to have solid conversations about the designs you're working on, and why getting a seat at the proverbial table isn't the endgame. <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/design-ux-interaction-iot/public/schedule/detail/45664?intcmp=il-design-confreg-lp-dsca16_20151105_radar_aaron_irizarry_radar_podcast_post_session_link">He'll be speaking about these topics and more at the O'Reilly Design Conference</a>, January 19-22, 2016, in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Here are a few snippets from their conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's really interesting to see an organization that didn't have a product design team as of, what, 2011, I believe, see the need for that, bring someone in, hire them to establish a team, which is my boss Chris, and then see just the transition and the growth within the company, and how they embraced product design.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The more we delivered, the more we built equity within the company to be able to kind of have more of a say. … What has really helped us is that we didn't just focus on getting a seat at the table. We focused on what to do when we have that seat, and how we keep that seat and bring others to the table as well.<!--more-->
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What are you going to do when you get that seat at the table? Are you going to go talk to them and be like, "design, design, design"? Are we going to push our agendas, and what we think is best as designers, or do we even understand the nature of the game? Especially in an enterprise situation, this isn't like Disneyland for designers. This is about trade-offs. This is about learning how to communicate and work with people. … Getting a seat at the table is one thing, but understanding what to do when you're there, and how to work with people in a way that allows you to keep that seat at the table, is way more important.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I learned that design doesn't matter as much, as far as doing what's right in design, and what the community thinks is the best way to handle something. Do what's best for the organization. Work with the people in a way that makes the product better. It makes them feel better about the work that's being done, and you're going to have much more longevity sitting at that table.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We all come from different backgrounds. We have different experience levels. We've gone to different schools, or worked at different companies. All that weighs into your experience, and the lens through which you approach design. You may say a certain term, and I may say that same term, but we understand it two different ways. The whole <em>Princess Bride</em> thing &mdash; that thing you said, I don't think it means what you think it means &mdash; that's really very common. It's really good to make sure that we understand what the person is getting at. If you can really do those things, keep your cool, not get offended, you really have a good chance to have really solid conversations about the designs that you're working on.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many of the open source systems and projects we've come to love &mdash; including <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/09/from-search-to-distributed-computing-to-large-scale-information-extraction.html">Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/04/coming-full-circle-with-bigtable-and-hbase.html">HBase</a> &mdash; were inspired by systems used internally within Google. These systems were described in papers and <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/09/from-search-to-distributed-computing-to-large-scale-information-extraction.html">implemented by people who needed frameworks</a> that could comfortably scale to massive data sets.</p>
<p>Google engineers and scientists continue to publish <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/08/vldb-2015-and-database-research-at.html">interesting papers</a>, and these days some of the big data systems they describe in publications are available on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/bigdata/">their cloud platform</a>.
</p>
<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/takidau">Tyler Akidau</a> one of the lead engineers in Google's streaming and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/">Dataflow</a> technologies. He recently wrote an extremely <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101">popular article</a> that provided a framework for how to think about bounded and unbounded data processing (a follow-up article is due out soon). We talked about the evolution of stream processing, the challenges of building systems that scale to massive data sets, and the recent <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/a-real-time-processing-revival">surge in interest in all things real time</a>:
</p>
<h2>On the need for MillWheel: A new stream processing engine</h2>
<blockquote><p>At the time [that MillWheel was built], there was, as far as I know, literally nothing externally that could handle the scale that we needed to handle. A lot of the existing streaming systems didn't focus on out-of-order processing, which was a big deal for us internally. Also we really wanted to hit a strong focus on consistency &mdash; being able to get absolutely correct answers. ... All three of these things were lacking in at least some area in [the systems we examined]. </p></blockquote>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>The Dataflow model</h2>
<blockquote><p>There are two projects that we say Dataflow came out of. The FlumeJava project, which, for anybody who is not familiar, is a higher level language for describing large-scale, massive-scale data processing systems and then running it through an optimizer and coming up with an execution plan. ... We had all sorts of use cases at Google where people were stringing together these series of MapReduce [jobs]. It was complex and difficult to deal with, and you had to try to manually optimize them for performance. If you do what the database folks have done,[you] run it through an optimizer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Flume is the primary data processing system, so as part of that for the last few years, we've been moving MillWheel to be essentially a secondary execution engine for FlumeJava. You can either do it on batch mode and run on MapReduce or you can execute it on MillWheel. ... FlumeJava plus MillWheel &mdash; it's this evolution that's happened internally, and now we've <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/">externalized it</a>. </p></blockquote>
<h2>Balancing correctness, latency, and cost</h2>
<blockquote><p>There's a wide variety of use cases out there. Sometimes you need high correctness; sometimes you don't; sometimes you need low latency; sometimes higher latency is okay. Sometimes you're willing to pay a lot for those other two features; sometimes you don't want to pay as much. The real key, at least as far as having a system that is broadly applicable, is being able to be flexible and give people the choices to make the trade-offs they have to make. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There is a single knob which is, which runner am I going to use: batch or streaming? Aside from that, the other level at which you get to make these choices is when you're deciding exactly when you materialize your results within the pipeline.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Once you have a streaming system or streaming execution engine that gives you this automatic-scaling, like Dataflow does, and it gives you consistency and strong tools for working with your data, then people start to build these really complicated services on them. It may not just be data processing. It actually becomes a nice platform for orchestrating events or orchestrating distributed state machines and things like that. We have a lot of users internally doing this stuff. </p></blockquote>
