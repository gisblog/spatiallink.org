<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From Lena Dunham to TechCrunch, it seems like everyone is getting into email newsletters these days. It should come as no surprise that email is becoming the new darling among publishers, since mobile users love to kick back and read a curated digest of great content every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As newsletters take off, it is important that publishers not just focus on click-through rates, but keep deliverability, inbox placement and readability top of mind. These factors could be the most important details in email marketing, yet are often overlooked by publishers who are blinded by clicks. However, an email that is not delivered to a subscriber’s inbox is effectively worthless; if a subscriber doesn’t get it, they can’t click through. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Engagement is one of the key factors that impacts deliverability. The ISPs look at what you are sending and who you are sending it to in order to determine whether or not it should be placed in the inbox or some other folder. The fact is that you don’t get placed in the inbox if people don’t open and click your messages. If your recipients are engaging with the communications that you are sending because they are well-formatted and providing valuable information, then the ISPs have no other option than to deliver your messages to the inbox. Engaged recipients are reinforcing the idea that the message is relevant and deserves good placement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating a strategy around engagement will improve deliverability, which will lead to a more successful email program. To boost engagement, you should consider the following points:</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Have a clear email-specific strategy.</strong> Don’t just dump web content in an email and call it a day. While publishers are very good at creating content, they are often challenged in determining which content makes the most sense in an email. Publishers need to make decisions about content based on who is signing up and customer behavior. Unfortunately, by not considering deliverability, publishers often end up formatting emails that are optimized to their website rather than considering how it would best generate traffic to the website. Instead, publishers should adopt a well-thought-out communication strategy for the email itself to improve deliverability and inbox placement.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Design for mobile &amp; execute campaign previews.</strong> As mobile engagement continues to grow, previewing becomes a necessary task before you hit send. Viewing how an email will look across webmail clients and mobile devices using rendering reports can help publishers optimize the creative, which in turn makes the message more clickable. This helps to optimize the creative before you send which in turn increases the chances of driving engagement. Better engagement equals better delivery rates.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Use targeting techniques to increase engagement.</strong> Unfortunately, a lot of publishers have a &#8220;batch and blast&#8221; mentality and send emails to anyone who has ever signed up for their list, and the emails become irrelevant for many. This can negatively impact deliverability rates. For example, if you have a million recipients on your list and you always send to the entire list, you could hurt your delivery if an overwhelming majority of those recipients never engage. It tells the ISPs that you aren’t sending relevant communications and could eventually lead to spam folder delivery. Because engagement affects inbox placement, targeting plays a role in deliverability, and publishers that want to land in the inbox should consider targeting their messaging.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Publishers have to send relevant, engaging content that people will open and click. If you send something that people don’t open and click, you will have challenges. If you don’t consider these elements, then you are not likely to find the inbox because poor engagement will lead to poor delivery rates. Don’t forget: if the email doesn’t make it to the inbox, no one will open it, no one will click on it, and you won’t make money. </span></p>

";s:7:"content";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";s:9131:"<p><em>Galia is COO and head of sales for <a href="http://www.taptica.com/" target="_blank">Taptica</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mobile video advertising ecosystem is headed toward a major eruption. By the end of next year, the industry will take colossal strides to combat fraud and eliminate bogus inventory, while simultaneously working to meet advertisers’ growing demand for mobile video ads. Savvy businesses will continue to buy or build platforms that allow them to offer a complete mobile video ad solution — the content, the audience, and the ad tech — and increase their revenue streams. As with any massive overhaul (and it will be massive), there will be casualties. But, the end result will be more effective and more secure mobile video advertising opportunities to help feed the already burgeoning demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here’s what we know. Advertisers and agencies are scrambling to create or fine-tune their mobile strategies and to contend with the now irrefutable fact that consumers are spending more time on their mobile devices. We’ve been talking about a “mobile-first” media landscape for a while; now it’s time for marketing strategies to catch up with user behavior. Simultaneously, consumer and brand interest in video is mounting, and for basically the same reason: high-quality video is engaging. Neither mobile nor video is without its challenges, but marrying the two helps alleviate some of the issues. Video mobile ads are more engaging than mobile banner ads. Couple that with the rich data we can harness through mobile devices, and you open up video to a host of new marketing use cases. Now we can monitor viewers’ subsequent behaviors and better measure the ROI of our investments. Video isn’t just for brand awareness anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within the next few years, it’s basically inevitable that the bulk of ad buying, mobile included, will be done programmatically. </span><a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Programmatic-Direct-Takes-Majority-of-Programmatic-Ad-Dollars/1013035"><span style="font-weight: 400">Spending levels are already soaring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Programmatic buying is lauded for its benefits, which include increased efficiency, more accurate targeting capabilities, and easy scalability. But it’s also rife with fraud. According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">research from the</span> <a href="http://www.whiteops.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Association of National Advertisers and WhiteOps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, 23 percent of video ad views are actually from bots. This is simply not acceptable. As an increasing number of brands and agencies look to embrace video advertising, they’ll clamor for more stringent regulations and better protection against fraudulent traffic. They’ll also take a hard look at programmatic trading, the practice of buying media and then reselling it for profit. In the not-too-distant future, 2016 will be the year brands demand more transparency across the board. The writing is already on the wall. BrightRoll has begun cleaning up its traffic and taking steps </span><a href="http://info.brightroll.com/traffic-fraud-in-video-advertising.html?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=library&amp;utm_campaign=2014Q4TrafficFraud"><span style="font-weight: 400">to educate the market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about the ubiquity of fraud. AppNexus, which has been a big player in programmatic trading, made huge strides this year by working to improve the quality of its inventory, limiting media arbitrage and </span><a href="http://blog.appnexus.com/2015/viewability-is-better-for-publishers-with-yieldex-analytics/"><span style="font-weight: 400">increasing viewability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Perhaps predictably, it’s also </span><a href="http://www.beet.tv/2015/08/appnexusokelley.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">shifting its focus toward video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.   </span></p>
<h3 id="mobile-media-consolidation"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobile media consolidation </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with the growing amount of fraudulent mobile video traffic, there is still a pressing supply and demand issue. There’s simply not enough inventory to meet advertisers’ needs. We’re going to have to rethink our definition of “premium” and become more open to running video ads in-stream and alongside user-generated content, a change that’s already underway—just look at the buzz Snapchat’s video ad product is generating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The increased demand for mobile video will continue to drive up prices for publishers, which is part of the reason why a growing number of companies are working to buy or create quality video content. Mobile media has already begun consolidating, as content distributors and content creators realize they’re more powerful together. Look at AOL’s acquisition of Adapt.TV, a programmatic video ad platform, and Vidible, a content syndication solution for publishers. (Expect to see an increase in the syndication of quality content as one solution to the challenge of meeting expanding demand quickly.) With these moves, AOL now has the audience, content, and technology needed to offer advertisers a full-service ad solution. And don’t forget, it’s owned by Verizon, which recently announced a plan to launch its own Hulu/Netflix-like app (</span><a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/landingpages/go90/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Go90</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) for streaming mobile video, and also revealed that </span><a href="http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/verizon-may-strike-partnerships-with-other-carriers-to-take-go90-international-1201613102/"><span style="font-weight: 400">its focus is on mobile video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">RTL Group’s purchase of SpotXchange last year and Facebook’s acquisition of LiveRail, the third-largest online video advertising management platform, are also harbingers of industry-wide change. Facebook can now extend its video ad reach beyond its platform, and LiveRail is already working to improve the quality of its exchange by cutting out providers who don’t work directly with advertisers. If they manage to improve their supply and leverage Facebook’s in-depth data, the results will be what marketers’ dreams are made of: the ability to reach their target audience via quality mobile video traffic while gaining precise insight into what type of creative is resonating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These types of intelligent mergers will continue as the industry works to reduce fraud, improve viewability, and better harness data. These changes will punish suppliers with less-than-stellar practices, but the net result will be an industry that’s more mature, regulated, and effective. Mobile video advertising will be a no-brainer investment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mobile video advertising ecosystem is headed toward a major eruption. By the end of next year, the industry will take colossal strides to combat fraud and eliminate bogus inventory, while simultaneously working to meet advertisers’ growing demand for mobile video ads. Savvy businesses will continue to buy or build platforms that allow them to offer a complete mobile video ad solution — the content, the audience, and the ad tech — and increase their revenue streams. As with any massive overhaul (and it will be massive), there will be casualties. But, the end result will be more effective and more secure mobile video advertising opportunities to help feed the already burgeoning demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here’s what we know. Advertisers and agencies are scrambling to create or fine-tune their mobile strategies and to contend with the now irrefutable fact that consumers are spending more time on their mobile devices. We’ve been talking about a “mobile-first” media landscape for a while; now it’s time for marketing strategies to catch up with user behavior. Simultaneously, consumer and brand interest in video is mounting, and for basically the same reason: high-quality video is engaging. Neither mobile nor video is without its challenges, but marrying the two helps alleviate some of the issues. Video mobile ads are more engaging than mobile banner ads. Couple that with the rich data we can harness through mobile devices, and you open up video to a host of new marketing use cases. Now we can monitor viewers’ subsequent behaviors and better measure the ROI of our investments. Video isn’t just for brand awareness anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within the next few years, it’s basically inevitable that the bulk of ad buying, mobile included, will be done programmatically. </span><a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Programmatic-Direct-Takes-Majority-of-Programmatic-Ad-Dollars/1013035"><span style="font-weight: 400">Spending levels are already soaring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Programmatic buying is lauded for its benefits, which include increased efficiency, more accurate targeting capabilities, and easy scalability. But it’s also rife with fraud. According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">research from the</span> <a href="http://www.whiteops.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Association of National Advertisers and WhiteOps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, 23 percent of video ad views are actually from bots. This is simply not acceptable. As an increasing number of brands and agencies look to embrace video advertising, they’ll clamor for more stringent regulations and better protection against fraudulent traffic. They’ll also take a hard look at programmatic trading, the practice of buying media and then reselling it for profit. In the not-too-distant future, 2016 will be the year brands demand more transparency across the board. The writing is already on the wall. BrightRoll has begun cleaning up its traffic and taking steps </span><a href="http://info.brightroll.com/traffic-fraud-in-video-advertising.html?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=library&amp;utm_campaign=2014Q4TrafficFraud"><span style="font-weight: 400">to educate the market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about the ubiquity of fraud. AppNexus, which has been a big player in programmatic trading, made huge strides this year by working to improve the quality of its inventory, limiting media arbitrage and </span><a href="http://blog.appnexus.com/2015/viewability-is-better-for-publishers-with-yieldex-analytics/"><span style="font-weight: 400">increasing viewability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Perhaps predictably, it’s also </span><a href="http://www.beet.tv/2015/08/appnexusokelley.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">shifting its focus toward video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.   </span></p>
<h3 id="mobile-media-consolidation"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobile media consolidation </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with the growing amount of fraudulent mobile video traffic, there is still a pressing supply and demand issue. There’s simply not enough inventory to meet advertisers’ needs. We’re going to have to rethink our definition of “premium” and become more open to running video ads in-stream and alongside user-generated content, a change that’s already underway—just look at the buzz Snapchat’s video ad product is generating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The increased demand for mobile video will continue to drive up prices for publishers, which is part of the reason why a growing number of companies are working to buy or create quality video content. Mobile media has already begun consolidating, as content distributors and content creators realize they’re more powerful together. Look at AOL’s acquisition of Adapt.TV, a programmatic video ad platform, and Vidible, a content syndication solution for publishers. (Expect to see an increase in the syndication of quality content as one solution to the challenge of meeting expanding demand quickly.) With these moves, AOL now has the audience, content, and technology needed to offer advertisers a full-service ad solution. And don’t forget, it’s owned by Verizon, which recently announced a plan to launch its own Hulu/Netflix-like app (</span><a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/landingpages/go90/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Go90</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) for streaming mobile video, and also revealed that </span><a href="http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/verizon-may-strike-partnerships-with-other-carriers-to-take-go90-international-1201613102/"><span style="font-weight: 400">its focus is on mobile video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">RTL Group’s purchase of SpotXchange last year and Facebook’s acquisition of LiveRail, the third-largest online video advertising management platform, are also harbingers of industry-wide change. Facebook can now extend its video ad reach beyond its platform, and LiveRail is already working to improve the quality of its exchange by cutting out providers who don’t work directly with advertisers. If they manage to improve their supply and leverage Facebook’s in-depth data, the results will be what marketers’ dreams are made of: the ability to reach their target audience via quality mobile video traffic while gaining precise insight into what type of creative is resonating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These types of intelligent mergers will continue as the industry works to reduce fraud, improve viewability, and better harness data. These changes will punish suppliers with less-than-stellar practices, but the net result will be an industry that’s more mature, regulated, and effective. Mobile video advertising will be a no-brainer investment. </span></p>

";s:7:"content";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";s:6104:"<p class="p1">Apple isn&#8217;t interested in transforming the Apple Watch into the ultimate health monitoring device, but the company is open to creating an entirely different product that would.</p>
<p class="p1">In a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11984806/Apples-Tim-Cook-declares-the-end-of-the-PC-and-hints-at-new-medical-product.html">recent interview</a> with The Telegraph, chief exec Tim Cook hinted at future involvement from Apple in health, but cited federal regulation processes as a reason it wouldn&#8217;t do so via its smartwatch. He did, however, talk about the possibility of an adjacent product (a gadget or app) that could have a serious impact on the health care industry &#8212; because, of course, Apple&#8217;s involvement tends to result in a pretty serious impact on every industry it touches.</p>
<p class="p1">While he gave few specifics, there are a few key factors surround FDA approval and technology in the health care sector that might help suss out what Apple has in mind. I caught up with Venkat Rajan, a health care analyst with market research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan to clarify a few things about health care tech, FDA testing and Apple&#8217;s place in the medical arena.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;To be clear in terms of definition,&#8221; says Rajan, &#8220;the FDA doesn&#8217;t dictate how a doctor can use a device as much as it dictates how you market what the device says it does.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">He gives the example of hearing aids versus sound amplifiers &#8212; two devices that do essentially the same thing and function in much the same way, but are marketed differently. Hearing aids are positioned as a treatment for hearing impairment and, as such, typically come from audiologists.</p>
<p class="p1">Sound amplifiers, by way of contrast, aren&#8217;t marketed as treatment devices. Because of this distinction, this class of device isn&#8217;t subjected to the scrutiny and regulation of the FDA and, as a result the product reaches the market and the consumers much more quickly.</p>
<p class="p1">So where does that leave Apple? Cook made it clear that they&#8217;re not going to chase down FDA approval for Apple Watch, but that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean that the company will leave a potentially lucrative market untapped &#8212; nothing would be more unlike Apple.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The real opportunities for Apple are something adjacent to the Watch and that probably means some type of peripheral, wearable-type technology,&#8221; Rajan says. &#8220;There are a lot of different potential wearables out there that are being explore and so it remains to be seen if Apple has a specific type of patient or disease profile in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">There are already FDA-approved apps and peripherals that are available for use with Apple Watch, though the watch itself is not FDA-approved. Apple Watch&#8217;s current role in the health and medical arena is as a conduit for health-related data and communications for those who work in health care. Its role isn&#8217;t particularly different from that of a smartphone or tablet though it is, perhaps, much more portable.</p>
<p class="p1">While its health data collection and activity tracking work well for personal use, the lack of FDA-approval means that the data from Apple Watch isn&#8217;t particularly useful for doctors looking to treat patients and track their progress, which is a key element of wearable technology in the medical space. The future of powerful medical technology for consumers will likely revolve around the degree to which doctors and patients can trust the data gathered by their devices.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;A lot of these devices do a good job of tracking information,&#8221; Rajan says. &#8220;But I think it is taking a lot of the types of information &#8212; whether it&#8217;s heart rate or activity or blood sugar sensing &#8212; and taking it a level deeper, [such as] being able to collect medical-grade data that an insurance company, hospital, or physician could take a look at and make decisions around.&#8221;</p>

Or at least that&#8217;s what the many companies trying to make it so people never have to use the springboard from which they can launch countless apps would like you to think. Why bounce from app to homescreen to another app when everything can happen all in one place? Why hunt for an app when it can send up-to-the-minute push notifications right to your lock screen?</p>
<p>Questioning the foundational assumption upon which modern smartphones were built &#8212; this being that apps are discrete entities that rarely interact &#8212; has led developers to make software that breaks down the silos between services. These apps have <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/keyboards-invaded-super-smart-apps/">snuck into software keyboards</a>, made <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/08/26/facebook-announces-a-new-digital-assistant-m/">their way into</a> one of the world&#8217;s most popular messaging apps, and <a href="http://www.imore.com/best-apps-notification-center-widgets-ios-8-all-things-glance">found other ways</a> to be omnipresent.</p>
<p><a href="http://cola.io/">Cola</a>, an iPhone messaging application that collects and presents information relevant to whatever its users are discussing, is exiting stealth today to enter that market. The app was created by former employees of Apple, Macromedia, AOL, and Adobe, and right now it&#8217;s asking people to sign up for its private beta test. It&#8217;s not clear when its creators plan to make Cola available to the general public.</p>
<p>Cola users will be able to schedule meetings, share task lists, and share their location through &#8220;Cola Bubbles&#8221; that present information without requiring people to leave the application. Eventually the app is supposed to get fizzier &#8212; sorry, add new features &#8212; that will allow its users to share information from third-party applications like the Fandango movie site or the FlightAware utility.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Cola Bubbles&#8221; will appear in-line for people using the app. For people who aren&#8217;t using it, however, the information will be sent through a link to a website. (Text messages are sent via SMS and will look the same across platforms.) This is supposed to make it so Cola users can use the app even if their friends aren&#8217;t, and it will also get the app in front of people who might not have heard of it.</p>
<p>It might still be frustrating for Cola users to make sure all their communications pass through the app. Non-users can&#8217;t initiate conversations; they&#8217;re restricted to responding to message threads started by Cola users. That might bother some people &#8212; how often do people start a new message thread? &#8212; but it will lead to some back-and-forth if a thread is closed or someone uses a new smartphone.</p>
<p>So how will Cola make money? &#8220;This is a free app. Everything you see now (and more) will always be free. Over time we will offer premium, for-pay features, so it will be a &#8216;freemium&#8217; model,&#8221; chief executive David Temkin says in an email. &#8220;We have a set of ideas of what those features might be, but the first order of business for us is to get users using the app. For-pay features will come later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Temkin assures me that user information will not be shared with advertisers, and that communications through Cola are encrypted, with the company holding the encryption keys. This means Cola is more secure than unencrypted apps but less secure than other services, like Apple&#8217;s iMessage, that don&#8217;t hold the keys.</p>
<p>All of this is supposed to make Cola a one-stop app that makes messaging a little less frustrating. Like other messaging apps its utility is limited if users&#8217; friends don&#8217;t use the service, and it might struggle in a world where many people have already <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/time-to-ditch-texting/">downloaded a bunch of messaging services</a> because the people they know are unable to settle on a single app through which they can all be reached.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s clear that Cola is part of a growing movement to make it easier for people to manage their lives without fumbling around with a bunch of apps. Given how pernicious these types of apps have proven &#8212; like I said before, they&#8217;re everywhere, from the iPhone&#8217;s keyboard to Facebook&#8217;s Messenger &#8212; perhaps it really is time to ring a death knell for the iPhone&#8217;s homescreen.</p>

";s:12:"atom_content";s:8820:"<p>The <a href="http://qz.com/512625/your-phones-homescreen-is-dead/">homescreen is dead</a>. Or at least that&#8217;s what the many companies trying to make it so people never have to use the springboard from which they can launch countless apps would like you to think. Why bounce from app to homescreen to another app when everything can happen all in one place? Why hunt for an app when it can send up-to-the-minute push notifications right to your lock screen?</p>
<p>Questioning the foundational assumption upon which modern smartphones were built &#8212; this being that apps are discrete entities that rarely interact &#8212; has led developers to make software that breaks down the silos between services. These apps have <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/keyboards-invaded-super-smart-apps/">snuck into software keyboards</a>, made <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/08/26/facebook-announces-a-new-digital-assistant-m/">their way into</a> one of the world&#8217;s most popular messaging apps, and <a href="http://www.imore.com/best-apps-notification-center-widgets-ios-8-all-things-glance">found other ways</a> to be omnipresent.</p>
<p><a href="http://cola.io/">Cola</a>, an iPhone messaging application that collects and presents information relevant to whatever its users are discussing, is exiting stealth today to enter that market. The app was created by former employees of Apple, Macromedia, AOL, and Adobe, and right now it&#8217;s asking people to sign up for its private beta test. It&#8217;s not clear when its creators plan to make Cola available to the general public.</p>
<p>Cola users will be able to schedule meetings, share task lists, and share their location through &#8220;Cola Bubbles&#8221; that present information without requiring people to leave the application. Eventually the app is supposed to get fizzier &#8212; sorry, add new features &#8212; that will allow its users to share information from third-party applications like the Fandango movie site or the FlightAware utility.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Cola Bubbles&#8221; will appear in-line for people using the app. For people who aren&#8217;t using it, however, the information will be sent through a link to a website. (Text messages are sent via SMS and will look the same across platforms.) This is supposed to make it so Cola users can use the app even if their friends aren&#8217;t, and it will also get the app in front of people who might not have heard of it.</p>
<p>It might still be frustrating for Cola users to make sure all their communications pass through the app. Non-users can&#8217;t initiate conversations; they&#8217;re restricted to responding to message threads started by Cola users. That might bother some people &#8212; how often do people start a new message thread? &#8212; but it will lead to some back-and-forth if a thread is closed or someone uses a new smartphone.</p>
<p>So how will Cola make money? &#8220;This is a free app. Everything you see now (and more) will always be free. Over time we will offer premium, for-pay features, so it will be a &#8216;freemium&#8217; model,&#8221; chief executive David Temkin says in an email. &#8220;We have a set of ideas of what those features might be, but the first order of business for us is to get users using the app. For-pay features will come later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Temkin assures me that user information will not be shared with advertisers, and that communications through Cola are encrypted, with the company holding the encryption keys. This means Cola is more secure than unencrypted apps but less secure than other services, like Apple&#8217;s iMessage, that don&#8217;t hold the keys.</p>
<p>All of this is supposed to make Cola a one-stop app that makes messaging a little less frustrating. Like other messaging apps its utility is limited if users&#8217; friends don&#8217;t use the service, and it might struggle in a world where many people have already <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/time-to-ditch-texting/">downloaded a bunch of messaging services</a> because the people they know are unable to settle on a single app through which they can all be reached.</p>

Instead, he estimated that Apple&#8217;s entrance as a competitor would be <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3048952/the-dj-behind-dash-radio-believes-apple-swiped-his-idea-for-beats-1-and-thats-a-good-thing" target="_blank">more positive</a> than negative.</p>
<p>That was nearly six months ago. Since then, Keeney&#8217;s words have proved true, with <a href="http://dashradio.com/" target="_blank">Dash Radio</a> doubling the total number of subscribers to more than 3 million. Dash told Gigaom that 2.5 million of those are active subscribers, or users that spend an average of 30 minutes per session listening to one of its 65+ human-programmed radio stations over the course of a month. (The company didn&#8217;t reveal how many sessions per month its users have, however.) Dash said it hasn&#8217;t spent much to market the service to drive that growth since launching, which I believe. The startup has only raised $2 million in seed funding to date, and doesn&#8217;t monetize with traditional advertising or monthly paid subscriptions.</p>
<p>Dash Radio initially launched in 2014 after Keeney became <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/03/dash-radio-wants-to-get-back-to-radios-roots-with-new-dj-curated-music-service/" target="_blank">disillusioned</a> with the compromises both terrestrial and satellite radio were making to support advertising. Because of this, radio has been pronounced dead by many people over the years, especially with the rise of Internet-connected cars with preloaded music services like Spotify, Pandora, and Rdio.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think radio was dead, too, if every listening experience you had over the last decade was basically circling through several genre-themed music stations &#8212; all of which present listeners with a guided list of approved or recommended songs from big labels, intermixed with periodic commercial breaks featuring irritating audio ads and DJs who sound like they&#8217;re paid minimum wage when on the air. That means streaming music services that simulcast terrestrial radio broadcasts aren&#8217;t much better. On top of that, there are now plenty of free streaming alternatives that offer greater control over the listening experience.</p>
<p>But those popular streaming services don&#8217;t really recapture the thing that made radio great in the pre-Internet era of music, according to Keeney. And casual human curation via shared playlists (a popular staple of Spotify) also falls short. &#8220;People don&#8217;t have time (or even want) to sit down and create a playlist with all the appropriate music,&#8221; he said, adding that most streaming services just feel hollow when you don&#8217;t know exactly what you want to hear.</p>
<p>Part of that is due to control. Dash Radio lets you switch stations, but that&#8217;s all the control you get over the content. You can&#8217;t skip, pause, or influence the playlist on Dash. The stations themselves are programmed by well-known artists (Snoop Dogg, Odd Future), magazines, celebrities, long-time radio personalities, and folks who are just really good at directing you towards interesting music.</p>
<p>But alas, Dash still needs to make money somehow. To do that, the service is focused on a mix of different revenue sources including a white-label version of its platform for celebrities and brand-sponsored stations. Both of those efforts also add value to Dash in the form of curated content that&#8217;s available in the station line up. For instance, the most recent example is a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/20/microsoft-partners-with-dj-skees-dash-radio-for-an-all-halo-music-station/" target="_blank"><em>Halo 5: Guardians</em> brand station</a> from Microsoft, which features cinematic music tracks from Halo.</p>
<p>The next phase of growth for Dash Radio will largely involve partnerships to increase its distribution in connected vehicles, smart TVs, smart home audio systems, and other devices that cater to those looking for streaming music services. Dash also wants to extend an olive branch to music labels to potentially generate revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a place for the labels, the big streaming services, and in future updates you&#8217;ll even see [integrations] that let you save or add songs you hear from a station on Dash,&#8221; Keeney said. &#8220;But we think radio curated by real people is still the best way to discover new music and hold your attention.&#8221;</p>

The startup has only raised $2 million in seed funding to date, and doesn&#8217;t monetize with traditional advertising or monthly paid subscriptions.</p>
<p>Dash Radio initially launched in 2014 after Keeney became <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/03/dash-radio-wants-to-get-back-to-radios-roots-with-new-dj-curated-music-service/" target="_blank">disillusioned</a> with the compromises both terrestrial and satellite radio were making to support advertising. Because of this, radio has been pronounced dead by many people over the years, especially with the rise of Internet-connected cars with preloaded music services like Spotify, Pandora, and Rdio.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think radio was dead, too, if every listening experience you had over the last decade was basically circling through several genre-themed music stations &#8212; all of which present listeners with a guided list of approved or recommended songs from big labels, intermixed with periodic commercial breaks featuring irritating audio ads and DJs who sound like they&#8217;re paid minimum wage when on the air. That means streaming music services that simulcast terrestrial radio broadcasts aren&#8217;t much better. On top of that, there are now plenty of free streaming alternatives that offer greater control over the listening experience.</p>
<p>But those popular streaming services don&#8217;t really recapture the thing that made radio great in the pre-Internet era of music, according to Keeney. And casual human curation via shared playlists (a popular staple of Spotify) also falls short. &#8220;People don&#8217;t have time (or even want) to sit down and create a playlist with all the appropriate music,&#8221; he said, adding that most streaming services just feel hollow when you don&#8217;t know exactly what you want to hear.</p>
<p>Part of that is due to control. Dash Radio lets you switch stations, but that&#8217;s all the control you get over the content. You can&#8217;t skip, pause, or influence the playlist on Dash. The stations themselves are programmed by well-known artists (Snoop Dogg, Odd Future), magazines, celebrities, long-time radio personalities, and folks who are just really good at directing you towards interesting music.</p>
<p>But alas, Dash still needs to make money somehow. To do that, the service is focused on a mix of different revenue sources including a white-label version of its platform for celebrities and brand-sponsored stations. Both of those efforts also add value to Dash in the form of curated content that&#8217;s available in the station line up. For instance, the most recent example is a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/20/microsoft-partners-with-dj-skees-dash-radio-for-an-all-halo-music-station/" target="_blank"><em>Halo 5: Guardians</em> brand station</a> from Microsoft, which features cinematic music tracks from Halo.</p>
<p>The next phase of growth for Dash Radio will largely involve partnerships to increase its distribution in connected vehicles, smart TVs, smart home audio systems, and other devices that cater to those looking for streaming music services. Dash also wants to extend an olive branch to music labels to potentially generate revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a place for the labels, the big streaming services, and in future updates you&#8217;ll even see [integrations] that let you save or add songs you hear from a station on Dash,&#8221; Keeney said. &#8220;But we think radio curated by real people is still the best way to discover new music and hold your attention.&#8221;</p>

";s:7:"content";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";s:7683:"<p>Facebook has <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/11/introducing-notify-a-notifications-app-from-facebook/">released a new application</a> called Notify that will allow its users to receive push notifications about breaking news, new movie trailers, and more.</p>
<p>The move into real-time news is significant because could help Facebook achieve two goals: It could make the company more important to the media, and it could increase the traffic it sends to publishers. Now, whether the app will be successful or just something that clogs up your phone&#8217;s notifications feed is another set of questions all together.</p>
<p>But as for the app itself, Notify users are tasked with choosing &#8220;stations&#8221; they want to follow. These are divided into categories from sports and politics to health and entertainment. Stations are managed by sources like the New York Times or People Magazine. Every source can offer multiple stations devoted to different areas of interest.</p>
<p>That might sound confusing. An easier way to think about it is that Facebook has basically taken the RSS feeds publishers used to have on their websites, renamed them, and made it so they can send push notifications to their followers&#8217; phones instead of quietly updating in the background of those followers&#8217; RSS readers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also brought them into an application it can control, and which will receive credit if publishers get extra attention for their stories. Facebook is essentially appropriating RSS feeds &#8212; a freely available tool any publisher could use &#8212; the same way it took the Web page and sought to replace it with Instant Articles.</p>
<p>Facebook has been transparent about its efforts to become the only platform that matters to large publishers. Instant Articles promise many benefits, especially the <a href="https://recode.net/2015/05/12/facebook-starts-publishing-the-new-york-times-buzzfeed-and-more-with-its-instant-articles-program/">speed with which they load</a> on mobile devices, but their primary function is keeping Facebook users engaged with its platform instead of the broader web.</p>
<p><a href="https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2015/11/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations.png"><img  src="https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2015/11/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations-804x670.png" alt="" width="804" height="670" data-attribution="Facebook" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-920712" /></a></p>
<p>Many publishers have bought into this scheme. Startup companies like Vox Media quickly supported Instant Articles, and even old media publishers like the Washington Post have decided to publish <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2015/09/22/the-washington-post-launches-instant-articles-on-facebook/">all of its stories</a> directly to Facebook. Facebook is already the most important referrer to most news sites, and it offers publishers a cut of advertising revenues &#8212; so, why not give Instant Articles a try?</p>
<p>Notify makes a similar value proposition. The notifications sent by the service appear on someone&#8217;s phone almost instantaneously; most RSS readers don&#8217;t offer similar mechanisms. Modern readers are all about speed, and making it so they don&#8217;t even have to load a website to read something is as fast as it gets.</p>
<p>Push notifications could also help Facebook bolster the traffic it sends to publishers. Digiday <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/facebooks-traffic-top-publishers-fell-32-percent-since-january/">reported earlier this week</a> that referral traffic to large publishers fell 32 percent between January and October. Such a large decline seriously threatens the control Facebook is able to exert over the media. But that&#8217;s only if people have stopped clicking on article links while also avoiding Instant Articles. The fall in referral traffic could well have been influenced by the rising popularity of Instant Articles, Digiday reports, because they&#8217;re specifically meant to keep users inside Facebook&#8217;s products instead of sending them away.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a bright side: Instant Articles <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/instant-articles-get-shared-more-than-old-fashioned-links-plus-more-details-from-facebooks-news-push/">are reportedly shared</a> more often than links to outside websites. Facebook might have damned the media industry by making publishers rely on its service for traffic, but it might also have provided the solution by creating a content delivery mechanism its users actually prefer.</p>
<p>The same principle could hold true for Notify. The app will buzz people&#8217;s phones when one of their stations shares something, and those people could then share that notification to Facebook. (They don&#8217;t even have to unlock their phone to do so; a &#8220;share&#8221; option is available right next to the notification on the lock screen.)</p>
<p>All of which means Facebook could funnel more users into its products instead of other solutions, just like it did with Instant Articles. In the process it could benefit publishers who support it and condemn the publishers who don&#8217;t because its users would rather share things via Notify than another service.</p>
<p>Notify is restricted to iPhone owners in the United States at launch. It&#8217;s not clear when it might expand to other platforms or locations &#8212; Facebook only says that it&#8217;s &#8220;excited to explore this evolving medium with participating sources.&#8221; This most likely means Notify&#8217;s performance in the US will dictate any expansions.</p>

<p>The updated profiles can now display a person&#8217;s job and education. Tinder says in a blog post that this was its most-requested feature, and that the addition will let users &#8220;make more informed choices&#8221; about potential matches and provide &#8220;great conversation starters&#8221; if both people confirm their interest in each other.</p>

(More on the company&#8217;s insistence that it&#8217;s not a hookup service right <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/08/12/before-ipo-tinder-says-theres-no-dating-apocalypse/">here</a>.) If anything, it now seems like a &#8216;Facebook for future friends.&#8217;</p>
<p>That contention is supported by the other update released today: A reorganized view of the messages Tinder users send to each other. The app now separates messages from people who have responded to each other (conversations) and messages that haven&#8217;t been responded to (introductions) into different sections.</p>
<p>Tinder users could use the service to message each other indefinitely. If they&#8217;re looking for platonic relationships, or if they end up making friends with people in whom they were romantically interested, they can use Tinder&#8217;s applications to communicate without having to worry about all the baggage Facebook carries.</p>
<p>Of course, that all depends on people adding information to their Tinder profiles and using the service to do something other than have one-night stands. The company says that&#8217;s how many of its users view the service; the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating">perception of the app</a> in popular culture, however, tells a different story about its users&#8217; intentions.</p>
<p>These changes might help promote Tinder&#8217;s view of its service. They might also just make it easier for the app to make more money when people run out of swipes or decide to send a &#8220;<a href="http://blog.gotinder.com/post/128712169906/updated-introducing-super-like-a-new-type-of">super like</a>&#8221; to indicate their desire to meet someone.

That&#8217;s up from about half its audience coming from mobile in January 2015.</p>
<p>Verizon-owned AOL has a large stable of high-trafficked digital properties, including the Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget, Moviefone, and many more, which have a collective global audience reach of about half a billion people per month, according to comScore. And while it&#8217;s not exactly surprising that more people are consuming content via smartphones and tablets, it is significant that AOL now has the audience to support its transformation into a mobile-first company. (That&#8217;s something <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/11/04/facebooks-transformation-into-a-mobile-company-is-complete/" target="_blank">Facebook also recently achieved</a>.)</p>
<p>The heavy mobile growth is thanks to a strategy that began over a year ago that entailed (obviously) a defocus on desktop; strategic partnerships; internal changes; and being acquired by Verizon, according to AOL global head of mobile Chad Gallagher. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a magic bullet, but rather this is the culmination of all those plans finally coming together. The [mobile audience growth] is a good proof point,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>The larger mobile audience may also help AOL&#8217;s new parent company Verizon (as well as AOL itself) justify the content side of the business, even though many speculate that it was most interested in AOL&#8217;s ad-tech platform. Digiday <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/verizon-deal-aols-content-sites-face-uncertain-fate/" target="_blank">reported</a> back in May that AOL had approached Time Inc. about selling the Huffington Post for a cool $1 billion. Similar rumors circulated about a sale of tech news leader TechCrunch, with AOL chief exec Tim Armstrong dismissing both claims and insisting the company would <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/12/aol-verizon-tim-armstrong-interview/" target="_blank">remain in the business of content</a>.</p>
<p>As for advertising, Gallagher said the higher mobile audience adds to recent efforts to further company&#8217;s ad business. Specifically, AOL&#8217;s agreement with Microsoft to take over most of its ad sales operations back in July, and more recently, closing on the acquisition of Millennial Media. Both of those efforts should help the company better monetize its own content.</p>
<p>The company, however, declined to share any stats on its mobile video audience. Yet, that&#8217;s an area of advertising AOL is increasingly interested in (as is the <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/11/10/why-its-impossible-to-put-snapchats-6b-daily-video-views-in-context/" target="_blank">rest of the industry</a>), which is clear from the <a href="http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/verizon-go90-launch-free-mobile-video-1201607727/" target="_blank">Go90 ad deal</a> Verizon and AOL made with Publicis Groupe last month.</p>

";s:7:"content";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";s:4899:"<p>Facebook has <a href="http://media.fb.com/2015/11/10/updates-to-live/">updated the Live service</a> it debuted in August to make it easier for people to know when one of their favorite public figures is streaming with the tool. Now, instead of having to chance upon a livestream while it&#8217;s still, ya know, live, users can subscribe to a feed and receive notifications when a stream starts. (The finished video is also saved to the streamer&#8217;s Facebook page for posterity.)</p>
<p>Live was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/05/facescope/#.fwdzfw:88lu">exclusive to celebrities</a> when it debuted, but it has since expanded to include other public figures like journalists and politicians. It&#8217;s basically the same thing as Periscope, the streaming app Twitter introduced earlier this year, with a focus on people with name recognition instead of anyone with a phone.</p>
<p>In addition to making it easier for people to use the service, Facebook has also shared for what appears to be the first time information about Live&#8217;s popularity. The company says that more than 60 percent of broadcasters are outside the United States; that some streams attracted 200,000 viewers; and that a stream where Vin Diesel spoke with his fans was seen by more than 1 million people.</p>
<p>There might be some contention about what Facebook counts as someone watching the livestreams. The archived streams automatically play, much like other videos shared to the service, and I suspect the livestreams do the same. It&#8217;s possible that a Facebook user scrolling through their News Feed might have become an unwitting tally mark simply because the video briefly started to play.</p>
<p>I wrote about the problems with <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/11/10/why-its-impossible-to-put-snapchats-6b-daily-video-views-in-context/">these types of measurements</a> earlier today when I covered Snapchat&#8217;s reported 6 billion daily video views. I argued that these measurements are all but meaningless, and that the only thing that matters is how these numbers change. (I&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook to clarify how they&#8217;re measuring views and will update this post if they respond to my inquiry.)</p>
<p>So is this proof that Facebook&#8217;s attempts <a href="https://pando.com/2014/07/17/facebook-launches-mentions-to-help-celebrities-interact-with-the-unwashed-masses/">to woo celebrities</a> are working? Might Live be the <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/08/19/facebooks-medium-like-notes-revamp-is-yet-another-copied-page/">first copycat service</a> Facebook has introduced in a while that won&#8217;t slip silently into oblivion? These numbers suggest that both of these things are true, but until we see some followup figures and Facebook clarifies how it&#8217;s coming by these measurements, we won&#8217;t have any kind of definitive answer.</p>
