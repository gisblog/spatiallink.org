<p>Esri recently released a <a href="https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-js-api">Bower package</a> to enable local custom builds of the API. The advantage of using a custom build is that your application downloads and parses only the required JavaScript resources which will make your application load faster. The Bower package can be used in conjunction with other JavaScript tools like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> to do optimized builds of your applications.</p>
<p><span id="more-56314"></span></p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p><a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> is a front-end package manager for your JavaScript projects. It allows you to download JavaScript packages that you can use in developing your applications. You can see examples of how to do optimized local builds in <a href="https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/bower">this resources project</a> that demonstrates how to do builds with <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> or <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have Bower installed, you can do so by following the <a href="http://bower.io/#install-bower">instructions here</a>. Once you have Bower installed, it&#8217;s very easy to install the ArcGIS API for JavaScript into your application with the following terminal command.</p>
<p><code>bower install --save arcgis-js-api</code></p>
<p>This will install the ArcGIS API for JavaScript into a directory called <em>bower_components</em> and you can start working with it in your application.</p>
<h1>What are the drawbacks?</h1>
<ul>
<li>You have to host the API yourself.</li>
<li>Longer than normal startup times.</li>
<li>Need to learn about how to build AMD projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CDN version (Esri hosted using a Content Delivery Network) has its advantages in that you do not have to host the API yourself. This may or may not be an issue for your development workflow.</p>
<p>The ArcGIS API for JavaScript is a large library with lots of modules to meet a variety of needs. While developing your application this can lead to longer than normal startup times as each individual module is loaded. This is however only an issue during the development process. AMD projects are meant to be run through a build process and once you do build your application, it will be highly optimized and load a minimial amount of files.</p>
<p>When you have completed developing your application and you are ready to deploy a release build, you will need to get familiar the build process. We recommend using the <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/build/">Dojo build tools</a> to optimize your applications. You can however use the <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html">RequireJS Optimizer</a> to build your applications.</p>
<p>We have provided build examples for both <a href="https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/bower/dojo">Dojo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/bower/requirejs">RequireJS</a>.</p>
<p>More detailed documentation will be available as part of the 3.15 release of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in a few weeks.</p>
<h1>Is Bower right for me?</h1>
<p>The Bower package of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript is meant to compliment the other channels for the API, via the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/intro_accessapi.html#cdn">CDN</a> or the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/en/downloads/">download to locally host it</a>. It is also not a replacement for the online <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/inside_web_optimizer.html">JavaScript Optimizer</a>.<br />
The JavaScript Optimizer provides you various methods to create an opimized build of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript for use with your specific application. The Bower package is for developers that want to integrate the build process into their current development workflows.</p>
<p>If you are currently using tools like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> or <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> to write your applications, you will find the Bower package useful.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>If you are comfortable with the CDN, locally hosting the API, or using the JavaScript Optimizer there is no reason for you to change your workflow.</p>
<p>If you have had a <em>deep desire</em> to get your hands dirty and integrate the ArcGIS API for JavaScript into your current build steps, then the Bower package may be just right for you.</p>
<p>Enjoy and build great things.</p>

<p>Each one of these resources are global in coverage and hosted as image services to provide full functionality throughout the ArcGIS Platform.¬† These services do require an ArcGIS Online log-in but do not utilize credits.¬† You can connect directly to these services in ArcGIS Desktop or these services can be used in web and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Some use-case examples of these datasets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deriving seafloor slope by accessing the Seafloor Bathymetry image service in ArcGIS Desktop and preforming Spatial Analysis Tools \ Surface \ Slope geoprocessing.</li>
<li>Generating contours from the Distance from Shore image service in ArcGIS Desktop by preforming 3D Analyst Tools \ Raster Surface \ Contour geoprocessing.</li>
<li>Obtaining seafloor temperatures for bottom fishing locations by accessing the Seafloor Temperature image service in ArcGIS Desktop and preforming Spatial Analysis Tools \ Extraction \ Extract Values to Points geoprocessing.</li>

<p>What do these sport teams have in common? In 2015, they all achieved success through teamwork. Teamwork is a fundamental component of success for many organizations and businesses. Esri is no different.</p>
<p>This Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS update includes contributions from several other Esri development teams (Data Reviewer, Imagery, and Solutions) reinforcing and promoting the idea of teamwork. They have helped contribute their expertise for some exciting new widgets in this release.</p>
<p><strong>4 new widgets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feature Report widget &#8211; This widget leverages the data validation capabilities of the <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver/extensions/data-reviewer">ArcGIS Data Reviewer for Server extension</a> to ‚Äúredline‚Äù features that are missing, miscoded, or incorrectly positioned. It enables you to collect and manage data quality feedback from users.</li>
<li>Reviewer Dashboard widget ‚Äì This widget works with the reporting capabilities of the <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver/extensions/data-reviewer">ArcGIS Data Reviewer for Server extension</a>. It displays data quality result statistics as infographics and &#8216;pie and bar charts&#8217; to summarize data quality issues identified in your GIS data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more about both these widgets in this blog post: <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2015/10/29/now-available-on-github-data-reviewer-widgets-for-web-appbuilder-for-arcgis/">Data Reviewer Widgets for Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS</a>. Both widgets are already available as <a href="https://github.com/Esri/datareviewer-webappbuilder-widgets">Dev samples on GitHub</a> for Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS Developer Edition v1.2, but will be part of Web AppBuilder embedded in ArcGIS Online soon!</p>
<ul>
<li>Image Measurement widget &#8211; Allows you to perform measurements on image services with mensuration capability. Mensuration is a method of applying geometric rules to find the lengths of lines, areas of surfaces, or volumes using information obtained from lines and angles.</li>
<li>Batch Attribute Editor widget &#8211; Enables you to select multiple features and update common attributes at once.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other enhancements</strong><br />
Some additional enhancements to Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps created with Web AppBuilder can be modified with URL parameters. This release adds support for 6 new URL parameters that enable you to find a location or a feature, authenticate users, query features, add a point on the map, switch locale, and specify WKID to zoom or pan the map.</li>
<li>The ability to save app state, including map extent and layer visibility, is now automatically saved when you close your web browser.</li>
<li>The Print widget supports custom text elements as layout metadata.</li>
<li>The Search widget has options to add placeholder text for all search sources and can search the current map extent.</li>
<li>The Attribute Table widget updates layers accordingly when they are changed in the map.</li>
<li>The Edit widget now carries over the editable attributes configured in the map.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last news item: the core Web AppBuilder Dev team have been very busy working on enabling some exciting new functionality. The picture below is a hint at what we are working on:</p>

<h1>Partner hosted content</h1>
<p>We have several partners who are already sharing content for trial through ArcGIS Online and we&#8217;ll be encouraging more to participate, especially as we improve the ArcGIS Marketplace next year. ¬†Many of you have seen the <a title="Pictometry" href="http://www.eagleview.com/Products/ImageSolutionsAnalytics/PictometryImagery.aspx" target="_blank">Pictometry</a> San Francisco buildings that were referenced <a href="http://j.mp/EarthBeta3DContent2" target="_blank">in one of my last posts</a>.</p>
<p>The pattern for partners (or customers) to share 3D and 2D content with their ecosystem is to establish an Organization in ArcGIS Online or in a Portal for ArcGIS Server that is outside a firewall, invite ecosystem participants (customers or partners) to their Organization, and then to share services into that Organization that can only be seen by participants.</p>
<div id="attachment_56196" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/files/2015/11/EarthBetaHonoluluCyberCity2_R.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-56196 noIMGBackground" src="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/files/2015/11/EarthBetaHonoluluCyberCity2_R-300x167.png" alt="Earth with CyberCity3D data" width="300" height="167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Earth with CyberCity3D data</p></div>
<blockquote><p>Note that to share 3D content, such as the 3D building scene layer shown in this example, you&#8217;ll need to publish the content from ArcGIS Pro to an on premises Portal for ArcGIS Server federated with Server (10.3.1 or later). ¬†We are looking at hosting such content in ArcGIS Online in the future.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Living Atlas Content</h1>
<p>Some Living Atlas content is not publicly shared and is available only to users with named user accounts (details available elsewhere). ¬†Esri customers and ArcGIS Online trial users can find restricted data layers in ArcGIS Online through ArcGIS Earth and will be prompted to enter their credentials before the data is added to Earth. ¬†Living Atlas content that is limited to named users can include curated and modeled ecological content, world traffic services, weather services, curated imagery services and more.</p>
<h1>Video demo</h1>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick look at working with partner and Living Atlas content in ArcGIS Earth 1.0 beta. In this case, we&#8217;re working with some data provided courtesy of¬†<a title="CyberCity 3D" href="http://www.cybercity3d.com/" target="_blank">CyberCity 3D</a>.</p>

<h3>Canadian data from Environics Analytics will be updated to 2015:</h3>
<p>The 2015 DemoStats data includes expanded demographic attributes and all-new themes such as Condominium Status, Recent Immigrants by Country of Birth and Generation Status. In addition to additional themes, the 2015 DemoStats attribute names have changed significantly from the 2014 DemoStats database. <a href="http://downloads.esri.com/esri_content_doc/dbl/int/DemoStats_2015-Variable_Change_List.pdf" target="_blank">DemoStats 2015 &#8211; Variable Change List.pdf</a></p>

<p>Previously released as PRIZMC2, the 2015 segmentation database provided by Environics Analytics is now PRIZM5. This release represents a re-clustering of segments. There are now 69 segments, up two from PRIZMC2 in 2014 and the attribute names are not consistent across the two segmentation systems. As a result, Esri recommends that all analysis with PRIZM segmentation data be updated. <a href="http://downloads.esri.com/esri_content_doc/dbl/int/PRIZM5_2015-Variable_Change_List.pdf" target="_blank">PRIZM5 2015 &#8211; Variable Change List.pdf</a></p>
<p>Esri recommends you consult the documentation for all attribute changes in the Documentation Release Notes and take care to update any workflows that access this data.</p>

<p>Standard Global Demographic data is sourced from Michael Bauer Research and available across the ArcGIS platform. Attributes vary from country to country, and include categories such as population, households, education, consumer spending and more. The datasets can be accessed in ArcGIS Online, Business Analyst, and apps such as Esri Maps for Office.</p>
<p>In addition to a vintage update, some countries have new attributes, attributes that are no longer available, and changes to geography names which are now standardized in English. View the Release Notes for each country on the¬†<a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/data/data.htm" target="_blank">Esri Demographics documentation</a>¬†pages for more details.

<h3 id="_U.S._2015_Retail"></h3>
<h3>U.S. 2015 Retail MarketPlace data will be updated with a new business data source, Infogroup:</h3>
<p>The 2015 USA Retail MarketPlace data will be updated due to a change in the underlying business data. Esri products now feature Infogroup business data. This data update does not impact the functionality of existing services or maps as there are no changes to feature IDs or attribute names. However, there are changes to attribute values due to the update. This update precludes comparison of 2015 Retail MarketPlace (with D&amp;B as the business source) and 2015 Retail MarketPlace (with Infogroup as the business source). Esri recommends that users of this data, in both maps and reports, redo any analysis involving this data after the update.</p>
<h2>How will these updates affect me?</h2>
<h3 id="_For_the_Ready-to-Use"></h3>
<h3>For the Ready-to-Use Maps User within ArcGIS Online</h3>
<p>Over 170 international demographic layers and maps, and a dozen United States layers and maps, will be updated.</p>
<p>The Retail MarketPlace update changes the content. No other changes to functionality, features, or attributes were made.</p>
<p>International demographic layers and maps now include geography levels presented in English, and no generalized layers in the content pane of ArcGIS Online. The left side of the picture below shows the older contents pane, and the right side shows the updated version available in this release.<br />

<h3 id="_For_the_Business"></h3>
<h3>For the Business Analyst User</h3>
<p>Business Analyst users will access the updated Canadian, U.S., and International data through reports and maps. The complete attribute list for each country is accessible through the <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/" target="_blank">Data Browser </a>contained in the application. Esri recommends that users of the 2015 Retail MarketPlace data, in both maps and reports, redo any analysis involving this data after the update to take advantage of the new source.</p>
<h3 id="_For_the_Data"></h3>
<h3>For the Data Enrichment user in ArcGIS Online or Esri Maps for Office</h3>
<p>The November 2015 update provides access to the Canadian, U.S., and International datasets shown above. Esri recommends that users of the 2015 Retail MarketPlace data, in both maps and reports, redo any analysis involving this data after the update to take advantage of the new source.</p>
<p>For a detailed explanation of new or deleted attributes in international datasets, see the Release Notes for each individual country available on the¬†<a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/data/data.htm" target="_blank">Esri Demographics documentation</a>¬†pages.</p>
<h3 id="_For_the_Developer"></h3>
<h3>For the Developer using REST endpoints for Standard Global Demographic Services</h3>
<p>No changes to the Retail MarketPlace REST endpoint were made to functionality, features, or attributes however the data has changed.</p>
<p>The REST endpoints for Standard Global Demographic datasets being updated in November 2015 will change. Over-generalized boundary layers will be removed and geography names will be standardized to English. These changes will impact any application calling the services. Some of the changes to the REST endpoints included in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in layer IDs</li>
<li>Changes to geography names (standardized to English)</li>
<li>Changes to attributes: attribute additions, and attribute deletions</li>
</ul>
<p>To view the new REST endpoints, you will need to access the <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r300000054000000" target="_blank">REST API</a> with a developer or organizational account, using a token request.</p>

<p>But in order to take advantage of new advances in technology to analyze, visualize and understand big data sets, like imagery and remotely sensed data, you first need to effectively manage your data.</p>
<p>Many times we get asked by customers as to the best way to get started, and there are several answers, depending upon the time, people and money resources your organization wants to invest.¬† You can manage everything yourself, on-premise, or break it up, and manage the transactional data on-premise and the static, less changing data in the cloud.¬† You can hire a professional services company, like Esri‚Äôs <a href="http://www.esri.com/services/professional-services/rent-a-tech" target="_blank">rent-a-tech</a>, who can provide a jump start package which does the dirty work of getting the foundation and structure started, and also on-site training for your people.¬† Or you can offload all of the effort to someone who can manage your imagery in the cloud, similar to our <a href="http://www.esri.com/services/emcs" target="_blank">managed services offerings</a>.¬† The choices are not cut and dried, and you can mix and match depending upon your needs and company requirements.¬† To help you get started on this journey, we‚Äôve put together an Enterprise Image Management white paper, which covers a lot of the topics you need to think about in detail, and explains thoroughly how ArcGIS technology can simplify managing imagery.</p>

<p>Many times we get asked by customers as to the best way to get started, and there are several answers, depending upon the time, people and money resources your organization wants to invest.¬† You can manage everything yourself, on-premise, or break it up, and manage the transactional data on-premise and the static, less changing data in the cloud.¬† You can hire a professional services company, like Esri‚Äôs <a href="http://www.esri.com/services/professional-services/rent-a-tech" target="_blank">rent-a-tech</a>, who can provide a jump start package which does the dirty work of getting the foundation and structure started, and also on-site training for your people.¬† Or you can offload all of the effort to someone who can manage your imagery in the cloud, similar to our <a href="http://www.esri.com/services/emcs" target="_blank">managed services offerings</a>.¬† The choices are not cut and dried, and you can mix and match depending upon your needs and company requirements.¬† To help you get started on this journey, we‚Äôve put together an Enterprise Image Management white paper, which covers a lot of the topics you need to think about in detail, and explains thoroughly how ArcGIS technology can simplify managing imagery.</p>
