De Troye</a>, GISP, South Carolina State GIS Coordinator and member of the NSGIC Board of Directors.</i><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.gaa-sc.org/wp">Geospatial Administrators Association of South Carolina</a> has published a guide to help local governments, as well as all other levels of government and the private sector, develop and implement GIS data access policies.<br /><br />The guide -- <a href="http://gis.sc.gov/documents/data_policy_framework.pdf">A Process Framework for Developing Local Government Data Access Policies</a> (PDF) -- grew out of discussions at the 2009 South Carolina statewide GIS conference. An informal poll discovered that some GIS organizations did not have a GIS data access policy, while others had a rudimentary policy, but almost no organization had a formalized approach in developing such policies. that led to a project focused on data access, data distribution and permitted uses that resulted in the creation of a guide to help GIS departments to step through the thought process on developing a policy.<br /><br />The guide takes into account key stakeholder personnel, different types of data, and different approaches to managing that data. Contributions to the document came from multiple organizations and levels of government including municipal, county, state, and federal agencies as well as from a utility.  While the document is written with the local organization in mind, it is applicable to different levels of government and can be used as a vehicle for policy development within the private sector.<br /><br />From the Overview: <br /><blockquote>In many organizations, the GIS manager has been charged with establishing GIS data access policy for the organization without the official authority to do so and without understanding the implications associated with policy implementation. Often, the result is a policy that is not formally adopted or a policy that has been established strictly from a legal perspective.<br /><br />The document serves as a process framework for developing an effective GIS data access policy. GIS managers can use this framework to help decision makers understand and formulate a GIS data access policy for their entire organization. The process encourages decision makers to review options for data distribution and carefully consider how implementing a policy will impact the organization, staff, private citizens, the business community, and other government<br />agencies.<br /></blockquote><blockquote>The goal is to enlighten and inform decision makers about specific GIS data access policy decisions. The goal is not for all government organizations to have the same policies, but for each organization to formulate policies using an informed and well thought out process.<br /></blockquote><blockquote>The document outlines a series of data access policy components that should be considered during policy development. Information about the components, suggested participants, and potential implications are presented for each. Readers are encouraged to utilize these components as a framework for policy development and to expand the content as needed to address the specific concerns of their organization.<br /></blockquote><blockquote>To help facilitate understanding and discussion, the document is written from the perspective of a non-GIS practitioner. This is the product of a collaborative effort among members of the Geospatial Administrators Association of South Carolina (GAASC). <br /></blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20825029-5399314431027627134?l=www.nsgic.org%2Fblog' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:150:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20825029/5399314431027627134/comments/defaulthttps://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20825029&postID=5399314431027627134";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20825029/posts/default/5399314431027627134";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20825029/posts/default/5399314431027627134";s:4:"link";s:72:"http://www.nsgic.org/blog/2010/01/south-carolina-publishes-guide-to.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Mike Mahaffie";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/17000411099910256177";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"0";}}i:17;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20825029.post-7788698363456070447";s:9:"published";s:29:"2010-01-13T08:54:00.000-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2010-01-13T08:54:11.793-05:00";s:5:"title";s:32:"“What Cannot be Measured…”";s:12:"atom_content";s:2424:"<i>Editor's Note: The following is a guest post from Dennis Goreham, retired GIS coordinator for Utah, and a member of the  National Geospatial Advisory Committee.</i><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/ngac">National Geospatial Advisory Committee</a> (NGAC) has endorsed, as a concept, a paper crafted by the NGAC Governance Subcommittee which seeks to promote the development of a <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/nsdi/nsdi.html">National Spatial Data Infrastructure</a> (NSDI) by creating a more precise definition of the NSDI and of a set of metrics needed to measure progress towards the NSDI.<br /><br />The paper – a <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/ngac/meetings/december-2009/governance-subcommittee-nsdi-metrics-paper.pdf">Proposal to Measure Progress Toward Realizing the NSDI Vision</a> (PDF) – takes as its central theme the truism that “what cannot be measured, cannot be managed.” It was presented at the December NGAC meeting and resulted in instruction that the Subcommittee begin implementation, including outreach to refine the metrics approach.<br /><br />The initial categories of metrics selected by the committee address many aspects of the NSDI beyond its original data-centric definition:<br /><ol><li>Societal metrics intended to determine the extent to which geospatial data, processing and applications have become part of the general information infrastructure and decision support process;</li><li>Environmental measures which describe the full extent of geospatial activities and their economic implications;</li><li>Data metrics providing evidence of progress toward the initial completion or the ongoing maintenance of framework data layers at a minimum;</li><li>Technology metrics for the fitness and quality of the underlying technology infrastructure in use across relevant organizations; and</li><li>Governance metrics to measure progress toward the realization of a national governance structure for the NSDI.</li></ol><br />Readers should note that the proposed measures are national in scope, and not merely federal.

Maryland Integrated Map (MD iMap)</a>" <span style="font-size: x-small;">(PDF)</span> that establishes an organizational structure to guide and coordinate inter-agency and intergovernmental efforts to share geospatial data and tools in Maryland.<br /><br />The order identifies and defines the role of an Executive Committee, including the Secretaries of all the state's cabinet agencies, and formally identifies and defines the role of the State Geographic Information Officer (GIO) as well as that of the Technical Committee.<br /><br />(NSGIC's own) Kenny Miller, who has been filling the role for all practical purposes for some time, is the designated GIO and will move later this year from his long-term home in Maryland's Department of Natural Resources to the Department of Information Technology.<br /><br />The executive order is focused on the creation of a "Maryland Integrated Map (MD iMap), which will serve as a statewide basemap and help state agencies to "better implement and coordinate policies across the State."<br /><br />"The execution of the Executive Order has been a long time in coming and reflects the value of laying the foundation over the years to prepare for this eventuality.  It also reflects the rapid increase in interest at the highest levels of State government in providing Marylanders with information of how their government allocates funds and where those funds are spent" reflects Kenny Miller, who becomes the State's first-ever GIO.<br /><br />"The <a href="http://www.msgic.state.md.us/index.asp">Maryland State Geographic Information Committee</a> (MSGIC) began in the early 1990's to grow GIS technology and foster collaboration and communication to among the various partners.  It wasn't until the O'Malley-Brown Administration began, in early 2007, to demand agencies use GIS to both target program efforts and funds and to measure progress that the interest on formalizing the governance and official capacity of the GIO really took root.  This represents a win for all those who have labored to make this day a reality."<br /><br />The Governor will provide strategic direction to the Executive Committee, which will be chaired by the Secretary of Information Technology.

NSGIC awards vary by nature, the number given per year, whether the effort is lifetime or focused on the previous year, the relationship of the award winner to NSGIC, and whether the award is typically given at the mid-year meeting or annual conference. No person can receive the same award twice. All awards consist of a plaque mounted on a walnut base and their names preserved on the NSGIC website.<br /><br />Nominations are now open for the Distinguished Service Award and the Dedicated Service Award.  Please review the attached criteria and consider making a nomination.  Please send all nominations to Tony Spicci at the address listed below.  Nominations will be verified for eligibility by the Awards Subcommittee. Each nominee will be individually evaluated according to the award criteria.  If a nominee is selected, the award will be made at the Midyear Meeting<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />              -- Tony Spicci<br /><br />Anthony A.

By the fall of 2008 most of the senior Bush political appointees had left their respective agencies and the government below the cabinet level entered a period in which many key positions were not filled.  In such an environment, career employees are well able to keep the government running, but significant operational change is unlikely occur.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/ngac/meetings/december-2009/index_html">December 2009 NGAC meeting</a> was notable for the energy and direction provided by the Obama administration.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Barack-Obama-Announces-Key-White-House-Posts/">Derek Douglas</a>, Executive Office of the President, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/05/01/CongratulationstoXavBriggs/">Xavier de Souza Briggs</a>, Office of Management and Budget, and <a href="http://www.doi.gov/ppp/jacksonbio.html">Andrew Jackson</a>, Department of the Interior, each spoke to the committee.

The amount of high-level attention that geospatial will get depends on our communities' ability to quickly mobilize and meet the needs of an administration that is hungry for the data and analysis. In this light, the administration’s <a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/7012-OMB-Budget-Guidance-For-Geospatial-Initiatives.html">budget guidance</a>, which calls of FGDC/Geospatial Line of Business to, “by April 1 … to provide recommendations to revise its <span style="font-weight: bold;">governance structure</span>, a 2012 business case and <span style="font-weight: bold;">budget request for imagery for the nation</span> and a modernization plan, including <span style="font-weight: bold;">a target architecture of the geospatial platform</span>” is perhaps the first and last opportunity to capture the imagination of the Obama administration by helping them do better what they are going to do with or without us.<br /><br />Also notable from the December NGAC meeting: a serious push from USGS on LiDAR that leverages many of the “For The Nation” principles.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20825029-2978770081509985990?l=www.nsgic.org%2Fblog' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:150:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20825029/2978770081509985990/comments/defaulthttps://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20825029&postID=2978770081509985990";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20825029/posts/default/2978770081509985990";s:9:"link_self";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20825029/posts/default/2978770081509985990";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://www.nsgic.org/blog/2009/12/obama-administration-arrives-at-ngac.html";s:11:"author_name";s:13:"Mike Mahaffie";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/17000411099910256177";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"0";}}i:22;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20825029.post-5090321020611286901";s:9:"published";s:29:"2009-12-29T13:55:00.002-05:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-12-29T15:08:30.220-05:00";s:5:"title";s:27:"An Idea to Improve Data.Gov";s:12:"atom_content";s:1862:"NSGIC has <a href="http://datagov.ideascale.com/a/dtd/16330-6440">registered an idea</a> on the Federal CIO Council's <a href="http://datagov.ideascale.com/"><em>Evolving Data.gov</em></a> web site. The site was developed as part of the <a href="http://www.cio.gov/">CIO Council's</a> effort to involve the public in the evolution and growth of <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a>.<br /><br />NSGIC leadership gathered via <a href="https://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> to discuss data.gov and how it might help with NSGIC's effort to support a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). Out of those talks grew an <a href="http://datagov.ideascale.com/a/dtd/16330-6440">idea</a>:<br /><blockquote>Data.gov should become a nationally managed "access point" that provides a mechanism for all levels of government to participate or integrate with, thus creating a single location for citizens to access government data. </blockquote>This idea matches NSGIC's vision for the NSDI; a nationwide collection of geospatial data that originates in local, county and state agencies and is aggregated up to the national level. It is an approach that counts on a national effort to develop and promote data standards and to manage the integration of data from all levels of government.<br /><br />"Nearly 30 of us tossed around a number of ideas and ultimately chose this as NSGIC's official submission," explained NSGIC President Will Craig (Minnesota). "I will ask the full membership to <a href="http://datagov.ideascale.com/a/dtd/16330-6440">consider this idea within the context of the Evolving Data.Gov site</a>.

It explains its purpose this way:<br /><blockquote>Before an aid agency can respond to a disaster, their first need is for...information. Where are the affected people? Where are the relief resources? Who is doing what already?<br /><br />MapAction delivers that vital information in the form of maps, created from information gathered at the disaster scene. By conveying a 'shared operational picture', our maps play a crucial role in delivering humanitarian aid to the right place, quickly.</blockquote>The Field Guide to Humanitarian Mapping includes basic introductions to GIS mapping and to the use of GPS to collect data.
