A major research partnership was announced today between FUGRO (provider of geotechnical, survey and geoscience services), the authors of Odysseus Unbound: The Search for Homer’s Ithaca (Robert Bittlestone, Professor James Diggle and Professor John Underhill) and IGME (Greece’s geological institute).<br /><br />The location of the island of Ithaca that is described in Homer’s Odyssey has been an enigma for nearly 3,000 years, but the radical new solution proposed by the authors in late 2005 is looking increasingly plausible as preliminary scientific findings appear to support the hypothesis.

The company employs about 10,000 staff in over 50 countries. FUGRO Chief Executive Klaas Wester comments:<br /><br />“The technical challenge presented by the project calls for a broad range of investigative solutions. This is an opportunity for FUGRO to showcase many of the specialised geophysical, geotechnical and survey services that we offer, while at the same time benefiting the local community and supporting research into our areas of expertise.

This allows you to add things like headers and watermarks very easily. There is a new File menu command called "Open Data File at Fixed Screen Location" that allows this.<br />    * Added ability to export any loaded data to tiled images for use in NASA's World Wind application. The new World Wind export option under the File->Export Raster and Elevation Data menu will correctly break your data up into tiles at various zoom levels and also create the necessary XML file to view your data in World Wind.<br />    * Added the ability to copy features selected with the Digitizer Tool to the clipboard and then paste that copied data into any running instance of Global Mapper by using the new Edit menu options.<br />    * Added ability for users to add support for additional raster and elevation export formats through a DLL-plugin architecture (see the Developers/SDK page at http://www.globalmapper.com for details). <br /><br />Many other enhancements and bug fixes were made as well. See the What's New page at http://www.globalmapper.com for a complete list of changes.<br /><br />Note that this is a free upgrade for registered users of any Global Mapper v8.xx product. Registered Global Mapper v7.xx users can purchase an upgrade for only $99 US from the Download/Purchase page at http://www.globalmapper.com . </blockquote>";}i:18;a:10:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-19801612.post-3455824051080441314";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 11 Mar 2007 20:03:00 +0000";s:4:"atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";s:29:"2007-04-12T22:54:39.436+00:00";}s:8:"category";s:39:"GISGlobal MapperNASAWorld windworldwind";s:5:"title";s:42:"update on Global Mapper World Wind support";s:11:"description";s:867:"<a href="http://www.globalmapper.com/">Global Mapper</a>, a GIS data viewer and converter, have been busy working to add World Wind tile export, the results I've seen are great.  <br /><br />The downside is it is pretty expensive software, and they ask for credit card details for the demo version, but here is the really great news, they will be releasing a free version of Global Mapper which will allow World Wind export with the limitation that every tile will have the word 'DEMO' written across the tile diagonally, an excellent way of testing the product out before parting with any hard earned cash.<br /><br />Global Mapper version 8.02 with WW export should be released tomorrow, so give it a try.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">EDIT : </span>I was wrong Global Mapper do not ask for credit card details to get the demo version of Global Mapper.";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://www.bullsworld.net/2007/03/update-on-global-mapper-world-wind.html";s:6:"author";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Daniel Baker)";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"2";}s:7:"summary";s:867:"<a href="http://www.globalmapper.com/">Global Mapper</a>, a GIS data viewer and converter, have been busy working to add World Wind tile export, the results I've seen are great.  <br /><br />The downside is it is pretty expensive software, and they ask for credit card details for the demo version, but here is the really great news, they will be releasing a free version of Global Mapper which will allow World Wind export with the limitation that every tile will have the word 'DEMO' written across the tile diagonally, an excellent way of testing the product out before parting with any hard earned cash.<br /><br />Global Mapper version 8.02 with WW export should be released tomorrow, so give it a try.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">EDIT : </span>I was wrong Global Mapper do not ask for credit card details to get the demo version of Global Mapper.";}i:19;a:10:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-19801612.post-1857054875129463502";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sat, 10 Mar 2007 04:10:00 +0000";s:4:"atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";s:29:"2007-03-10T05:18:45.291+00:00";}s:8:"category";s:37:"NASASpaceNavigatorWorld windworldwind";s:5:"title";s:49:"3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator support for World Wind";s:11:"description";s:3212:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_J6SwEIk3TJY/RfI7YwlWOiI/AAAAAAAAAJI/gtdzpluQRic/s1600-h/3dnavblog.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_J6SwEIk3TJY/RfI7YwlWOiI/AAAAAAAAAJI/gtdzpluQRic/s320/3dnavblog.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5040156229525453346" /></a><br />Well I have had my SpaceNavigator for over a week now (thank you NASA/3D Connexion), so its about time I reviewed it.<br /><br />I'll start with the basics, first off this wont replace your mouse, it is designed to be used along side it, application support is pretty good out of the box (with the latest drivers) with an emphasis on CAD and 3D design software, which of course it's perfect for.
