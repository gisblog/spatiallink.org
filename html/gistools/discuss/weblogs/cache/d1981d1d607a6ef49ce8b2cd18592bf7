This is great news, adding to the native SpatiaLite<sup>2</sup> support ecosystem which includes <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a>/OGR, <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a>, <a href="http://www.geoalchemy.org/">GeoAlchemy</a>, and probably others (let me know in the comments!).</p>
<p>Being in a precipitous mood, I decided to plunge in and get my clichÃ©s wet.  The first step was to attempt to use the new provider with <a href="http://themapguyde.blogspot.com/">Jackie Ng</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fdotoolbox/">FDO Toolbox</a>, my go-to GUI tool for examining FDO data sets.  I followed these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sl-king.com/fdospatialite/download/download.html">Downloaded the 32 bit FDO 3.5 version of the new SpatiaLite provider</a> from the SL-King website.</li>
<li>Copied all of the files into my <strong>C:\Program Files\FDO Toolbox\FDO</strong> directory.</li>
<li>Copied the contents of the <strong>providers_kingspatialite_entry.xml</strong> file into the <strong>providers.xml</strong> file before the closing FeatureProviderRegistry tag, modifying the FDO version string to 3.5.</li>
<li>Discovered that something had a dependency on the MS Visual C++ 7.1 runtime, so I found msvcr71.dll and msvcp71.dll on another PC and copied them into the same directory</li>
</ol>
<p>With this in place, I was able to quickly connect to the <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/resources.html">SpatiaLite demo database</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/spatialite-fdotb-dataconn.jpg" alt="" title="spatialite-fdotb-dataconn" width="437" height="358" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-522" /></p>
<p>And browse and visualize the data:</p>
<p><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/spatialite-fdotb-gridview.jpg" alt="" title="spatialite-fdotb-gridview" width="426" height="329" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-524" /><img src="http://c9.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/spatialite-fdotb-mapview.jpg" alt="" title="spatialite-fdotb-mapview" width="427" height="328" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-525" /></p>
<p>Confidence buoyed, I decided to take it a step further and attempt to connect to the same data in MapGuide.  The initial steps were the same as for FDO Toolbox (adding the provider to the MapGuide FDO folder).  </p>
<p>Once configured, I was able to quickly add a connection to the test database, but I had to manually hack in a coordinate system reference and map extents.  This is due to an incompatibility between SpatiaLite and MapGuide&#8217;s coordinate system handling, and I&#8217;m hoping that the <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.4.0-3/changelog.html">WKT projection support in the next version of SpatiaLite</a> allows Haris to fix this.</p>

<p>With the data connection and its spatial context override in place, creating layer and map definitions was dead easy, and allowed me to quickly get to data visualization.</p>

<p>Next Up?  Making the SpatiaLite FDO provider work with <a href="http://www.georest.org/">GeoREST</a>.  Out of time for tonight though&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> (2010-09-01):  I was able to get the SpatiaLite provider working with the current preview version of GeoREST with very little difficulty, and the next official build of GeoREST will probably include this provider.  If you&#8217;d like to play around with it earlier, you can download a totally unsupported package of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jasonbirch.com/temp/GeoREST-1.1.3.SpatiaLite.x86.7z">GeoREST with Spatialite</a> from my temp files area for a limited time only :)</p>

<p>This past week was an interesting bit of synchronicity.  First, Ross took advantage of a Costco sale on the<a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=142&#038;pID=11039"> Garmin Forerunner 405</a>, a really interesting bit of sports gadgetry that gives you real time location and performance information including heart rate.  </p>
<div id="attachment_478" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 306px"><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/garmin_forerunner_405.png" alt="Garmin Forerunner 405" title="Garmin Forerunner 405" width="296" height="294" class="size-full wp-image-478"  /><p class="wp-caption-text">Garmin Forerunner 405</p></div>
<p>Second, <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2010/06/announcing-google-earth-52.html">Google released Google Earth 5.2</a> with considerable enhancements including elevation profiles and the inclusion of additional data (such as heart rate) in its GPS import function.</p>
<div id="attachment_491" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2010/06/announcing-google-earth-52.html"><img src="http://c11.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/google_earth_pro_demographics.jpg" alt="Google Earth 5.2" title="Google Earth 5.2" width="500" height="346" class="size-full wp-image-491" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Google Earth 5.2</p></div>
<p>And third, this weekend Ross took part in the <a href="http://www.kusamklimb.com/index.php/about/about">Kusam Klimb</a>, a gnarly 23 km long trek over Mount H&#8221;Kusam near Sayward BC, featuring rugged conditions and a 1.5 km change in elevation.  Make sure you check out <a href="http://www.kusamklimb.com/index.php/about/klimb-konditions">this year&#8217;s conditions</a>&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_480" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://www.kusamklimb.com/index.php/klimb-konditions"><img src="http://c11.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/kusan_klimb.jpg" alt="Kusam Klimb" title="Kusam Klimb" width="450" height="299" class="size-full wp-image-480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kusam Klimb in Google Earth</p></div>
<p>After completing the event, Ross somehow managed to summon up the energy to post a<a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/37455904"> link to his data upload</a> on Facebook.  I have to say, Garmin&#8217;s <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/player/37455904">web-based visualizer</a> is very nice!  it combines a graph, a map, and gauges in a very clear and easy to use format.</p>
<div id="attachment_481" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/player/37455904"><img src="http://c11.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/garmin_player.png" alt="Garmin Player" title="Garmin Player" width="450" height="390" class="size-full wp-image-481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Garmin Player</p></div>
<p>If you visit the <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/37455904">activity page</a>, you will notice that below the map you can export as <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/schemas/">TCX</a>, <a href="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp">GPX</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">KML</a> files.  Garmin&#8217;s KML file is actually a very nice time-enabled presentation, but it doesn&#8217;t include the heart rate or speed data.  For this, you need to download the GPX file.  The easiest way to open it in Google Earth is to drag it into the globe window.  This pops up a dialogue asking what features you want in the generated KML, and then creates a new file in your Temporary Places.</p>
<div id="attachment_489" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 345px"><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Google-Earth-GPS-Data-Import.png" alt="Google Earth - GPS Data Import" title="Google Earth - GPS Data Import" width="335" height="195" class="size-full wp-image-489" /><p class="wp-caption-text">GPS Data Import</p></div>
<p>Now the fun begins.  Of course, the obvious first step is to click on the Play button in the time menu to watch Ross run the trail&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_490" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 492px"><img src="http://c11.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/WindowClipping-3.png" alt="Google Earth GPX Animation" title="Google Earth GPX Animation" width="482" height="289" class="size-full wp-image-490" /><p class="wp-caption-text">GPX Animation</p></div>
<p>But that capability has been there for a while.  What I find really interesting is the extra data that the GPX file brought along for the ride: heart rate, elevation, and speed.  You can see the heart rate and speed (I think it may pull elevation from the terrain) by right-clicking anywhere on the track and choosing Show Elevation Profile.  This gives you a cool interactive screen where you can display up to two variables, position your mouse anywhere along the graph, and see the information on the globe.</p>
<div id="attachment_493" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 560px"><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ross_run.jpg" alt="The Run of Ross" title="The Run of Ross" width="550" height="506" class="size-full wp-image-493" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ross on the Kusam Klimb</p></div>
<p>I have to admit that I have some reservations about this.  The profile was very usable, but the design didn&#8217;t really fit with the rest of the Google Earth interface, and I would have liked to see all three data points (elevation, speed, and heart rate) at once.  Fortunately, Google is well known for its incremental improvements, and I&#8217;m sure that it will get better over time.</p>
<p>Something else you can do with GPX data is create a Tour of your run and follow along with dizzying swoops and dips :)  To do this, import the GPX as a linestring instead of a track, then expand the legend until you get to the Path and click on the &#8220;Play&#8221; button, and finally save the path tour.</p>
<div id="attachment_494" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 267px"><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ExportPath.png" alt="Play the Path" title="ExportPath" width="257" height="155" class="size-full wp-image-494" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Play the Path</p></div>
<div id="attachment_495" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 384px"><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/SaveTour.png" alt="Save as Tour" title="SaveTour" width="374" height="63" class="size-full wp-image-495" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Save as Tour</p></div>
<p>You may need to play around with the Tour Settings in the Google Earth options a bit to get the correct zoom and speed, but eventually you&#8217;ll end up with something like the link below.  Download the file, expand it in the Google Earth menu, and double-click on the Tour for some dorm-room-Quake queasiness:</p>

<p>Something else you can do with GPX data is create a Tour of your run and follow along with dizzying swoops and dips :)  To do this, import the GPX as a linestring instead of a track, then expand the legend until you get to the Path and click on the &#8220;Play&#8221; button, and finally save the path tour.</p>

<p>You may need to play around with the Tour Settings in the Google Earth options a bit to get the correct zoom and speed, but eventually you&#8217;ll end up with something like the link below.  Download the file, expand it in the Google Earth menu, and double-click on the Tour for some dorm-room-Quake queasiness:</p>

Here are my picks for the top 10 features of MapGuide Maestro 2.0:</p>
<p><strong>1. Theming, with ColorBrewer Suport</strong></p>
<p>Being able to theme maps based on data distribution is a basic mapping function, and this release of Maestro delivers.  Adding support for <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">ColorBrewer</a> means that you can be confident that your colour scheme is visually distinct and cartographically appropriate for the message that you are conveying.  The Maestro UI automatically constrains the colour choices based on the underlying data categories:</p>
<p><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ColorBrewer.png" alt="" title="ColorBrewer" width="392" height="397" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-401" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Expression Editor</strong></p>
<p>MapGuide and the underlying FDO data providers support a powerful expression language, and previously you were on your own to write valid expressions.  Thanks to <a href="http://themapguyde.blogspot.com/">Jackie Ng</a>, MapGuide Maestro was able to use the same expression editor that FDO Toolbox is using, giving expression-completion, valid value extraction, and more:</p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ExpressionEditor.png" alt="" title="ExpressionEditor" width="497" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-413" /></p>
<p>Check out Jackie&#8217;s posts on the <a href="http://themapguyde.blogspot.com/2009/07/expression-editor-gets-bit-smarter.html">FDO Expression Editor</a> and the follow-up where he talks about the <a href="http://themapguyde.blogspot.com/2009/09/fdo-toolbox-v082.html">addition of value auto-completion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Resource Validation</strong></p>
<p>The Maestro resource validator walks from application to map to layers to data, warning if it detects any common errors such as broken references or potential performance issues like unmatched projections.  This is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting problems in your maps:</p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Validator_1.png" title="Validator_1" alt="Resource Validator Init" width="268" height="133" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-399" /></p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Validator_2.png" alt="Resource Validator Results" title="Validator_2" width="603" height="303" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-400" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Improved XML Editor</strong></p>
<p>While Maestro&#8217;s GUI is great for most purposes, there are times when you need to access the full power of MapGuide XML configuration syntax, like when you&#8217;re editing complex XML-based stylization elements.  Maestro makes it easy for you to edit any resource as XML simply by right-clicking on it and choosing &#8220;Edit as xml&#8221;.  Maestro 2.0 comes with many improvements to the XML editor, including validation against the schema, cursor position (important when tracking down errors), and the ability to attach arbitrary files to the current resource, which is critical when making bitmap-based symbols:</p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/XML_Editor.png" alt="" title="XML_Editor" width="618" height="427" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-405" /></p>
<p><strong>5. Profiling</strong></p>
<p>Profiling allows you to easily find the performance bottlenecks on a given map, or quickly determine whether changes to theming or other items are having an impact on performance:</p>
<p><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Profiler_Init.png" alt="" title="Profiler_Init" width="123" height="56" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-406" /></p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Profiler_Output.png" alt="" title="Profiler_Output" width="191" height="84" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-407" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Package Management</strong></p>
<p>MapGuide packages are a zipped export of the DBXML repository including XML resources, associated binary files, and a manifest.  Typically these are managed on the server, but Maestro allows you to create, edit, and load these files via the GUI. This can be really handy when you&#8217;re migrating changes between servers.  One of my favourite tricks is to export both test and prod as packages, unzip them, and compare using <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> (not free, but worth every penny).</p>
<p><img src="http://c9.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/PackageMenu.png" alt="" title="PackageMenu" width="250" height="96" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-411" /></p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/PackageCreator.png" alt="" title="PackageCreator" width="692" height="324" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-410" /></p>
<p><strong>7. Custom Resource Templates</strong></p>
<p>Any time you are creating a new data source, layer definition, map definition, etc, you are basically just creating a new XML document.  If you find that you are always performing certain steps as part of creating these resources, you can create your own custom resource types with customized versions of these XML documents.  For instance, I like to start layer creation using the version 1.3 of the LayerDefinition schema, with a default scale range of 1:1->1:500,000, and none of the feature types being displayed.  All I had to do was create a new LayerDefinition with these settings, save it to the MapGuideMaestro\Templates directory with a name like &#8220;Nanaimo Layer.xml&#8221;, and it shows up when I want to create a new resource:</p>

<p><strong>8. Duplicate Resource</strong></p>
<p>This might not seem like a big deal, but when creating dozens of similar layers it can be a huge timesaver.  Simply right-click on any resource and choose &#8220;Duplicate&#8221; and a copy of that resource is created and ready for you to customize:</p>

<p><strong>9. Colour-Coded Resource Tree</strong></p>
<p>When editing many resources at once, things can get a bit confusing.  Crispin Hoult from <a href="http://www.1spatial.com/">1Spatial</a> contributed a feature that colour-codes currently open resources in green, and resources that have unsaved changes in pink. The currently active resource comes up in a darker shade.  This feature makes it much easier to keep track of what&#8217;s going on in your work area, and is surprisingly useful:</p>

<p><strong>10. General Usability</strong></p>
<p>OK, maybe this doesn&#8217;t count as a feature, but a LOT of thought has been put into how various user interactions work, and countless small refinements have been made.  A few examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>inserting a new layer into a map definition when you have a group selected inserts the layer into that group, and places the layer into the overall draw order right after the bottom-most layer in that group
</li>
<li>you can now right-click on any resource and copy its ID (like Library://Nanaimo/Data/MyFile.FeatureSource) to the clipboard, which can be incredibly useful when writing code to access resources</li>
<li>you can multi-select many layers for insertion into a MapDefinition at once</li>
<li>maestro keeps track of references when you rename or move resources, prompting you for whether you want dependent resources updated</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the little enhancements in this release added together have saved me hours of work (I&#8217;ve been using the pre-release versions for a few months).</p>
<p>All-in-all this is a very impressive release, with countless new features and enhancements to existing functionality.  Give it a spin, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll turn up your own favourites!</p>
<p>Thanks Kenneth, and great work.</p>

Here are my picks for the top 10 features of MapGuide Maestro 2.0:</p>
<p><strong>1. Theming, with ColorBrewer Suport</strong></p>
<p>Being able to theme maps based on data distribution is a basic mapping function, and this release of Maestro delivers.  Adding support for <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">ColorBrewer</a> means that you can be confident that your colour scheme is visually distinct and cartographically appropriate for the message that you are conveying.  The Maestro UI automatically constrains the colour choices based on the underlying data categories:</p>
<p><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ColorBrewer.png" alt="" title="ColorBrewer" width="392" height="397" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-401" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Expression Editor</strong></p>
<p>MapGuide and the underlying FDO data providers support a powerful expression language, and previously you were on your own to write valid expressions.  Thanks to <a href="http://themapguyde.blogspot.com/">Jackie Ng</a>, MapGuide Maestro was able to use the same expression editor that FDO Toolbox is using, giving expression-completion, valid value extraction, and more:</p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ExpressionEditor.png" alt="" title="ExpressionEditor" width="497" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-413" /></p>
<p>Check out Jackie&#8217;s posts on the <a href="http://themapguyde.blogspot.com/2009/07/expression-editor-gets-bit-smarter.html">FDO Expression Editor</a> and the follow-up where he talks about the <a href="http://themapguyde.blogspot.com/2009/09/fdo-toolbox-v082.html">addition of value auto-completion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Resource Validation</strong></p>
<p>The Maestro resource validator walks from application to map to layers to data, warning if it detects any common errors such as broken references or potential performance issues like unmatched projections.  This is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting problems in your maps:</p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Validator_1.png" title="Validator_1" alt="Resource Validator Init" width="268" height="133" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-399" /></p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Validator_2.png" alt="Resource Validator Results" title="Validator_2" width="603" height="303" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-400" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Improved XML Editor</strong></p>
<p>While Maestro&#8217;s GUI is great for most purposes, there are times when you need to access the full power of MapGuide XML configuration syntax, like when you&#8217;re editing complex XML-based stylization elements.  Maestro makes it easy for you to edit any resource as XML simply by right-clicking on it and choosing &#8220;Edit as xml&#8221;.  Maestro 2.0 comes with many improvements to the XML editor, including validation against the schema, cursor position (important when tracking down errors), and the ability to attach arbitrary files to the current resource, which is critical when making bitmap-based symbols:</p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/XML_Editor.png" alt="" title="XML_Editor" width="618" height="427" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-405" /></p>
<p><strong>5. Profiling</strong></p>
<p>Profiling allows you to easily find the performance bottlenecks on a given map, or quickly determine whether changes to theming or other items are having an impact on performance:</p>
<p><img src="http://c10.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Profiler_Init.png" alt="" title="Profiler_Init" width="123" height="56" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-406" /></p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Profiler_Output.png" alt="" title="Profiler_Output" width="191" height="84" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-407" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Package Management</strong></p>
<p>MapGuide packages are a zipped export of the DBXML repository including XML resources, associated binary files, and a manifest.  Typically these are managed on the server, but Maestro allows you to create, edit, and load these files via the GUI. This can be really handy when you&#8217;re migrating changes between servers.  One of my favourite tricks is to export both test and prod as packages, unzip them, and compare using <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> (not free, but worth every penny).</p>
<p><img src="http://c9.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/PackageMenu.png" alt="" title="PackageMenu" width="250" height="96" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-411" /></p>
<p><img src="http://c12.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/PackageCreator.png" alt="" title="PackageCreator" width="692" height="324" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-410" /></p>
<p><strong>7. Custom Resource Templates</strong></p>
<p>Any time you are creating a new data source, layer definition, map definition, etc, you are basically just creating a new XML document.  If you find that you are always performing certain steps as part of creating these resources, you can create your own custom resource types with customized versions of these XML documents.  For instance, I like to start layer creation using the version 1.3 of the LayerDefinition schema, with a default scale range of 1:1->1:500,000, and none of the feature types being displayed.  All I had to do was create a new LayerDefinition with these settings, save it to the MapGuideMaestro\Templates directory with a name like &#8220;Nanaimo Layer.xml&#8221;, and it shows up when I want to create a new resource:</p>
<p><img src="http://c9.jasonbirch.com/nodes/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/NewCustomResource.png" alt="" title="NewCustomResource" width="415" height="276" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-412" /></p>
<p><strong>8. Duplicate Resource</strong></p>
<p>This might not seem like a big deal, but when creating dozens of similar layers it can be a huge timesaver.  Simply right-click on any resource and choose &#8220;Duplicate&#8221; and a copy of that resource is created and ready for you to customize:</p>
