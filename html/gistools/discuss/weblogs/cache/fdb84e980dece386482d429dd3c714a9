He had a few brief questions for me. I thought I'd post my reply here as well.</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"><br /><br /><span class="q">--------------------------------------</span><br /><br /></span><span class="q"><b><span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:14;"  >Q - First, coming from an environmentally based school that's all I hear about in terms of GIS jobs, is that the only market for it or are there other uses?</span></b></span><span class="q"><b><span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:13;"  >  </span></b></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;">A - Short answer no (but you probably already knew this).<br /><br />I'll give my long answer by giving you my view of GIS careers:<br /><br />First, <b>most jobs involve working with commercial GIS software</b> <b>to solve problems. </b>ESRI, Intergraph, MapInfo software, AutoDesk, and even Microsoft are players in then GIS software business. This work may involve making maps, building/editing geographic data etc. Some jobs are less technical (using GIS software, managing people that use GIS software), others are more technical (developing software applications that make GIS software do something special).<br /><br />Yes there are other jobs out there, e.g. you could work at ESRI on the software development team that builds the commercial software. This is what I used to do, but this is more software development and less GIS.<br /><br />So, some <b>common GIS career positions </b>-- after all you're looking for a career, not just a job, right.... great interview answer by the way ; )<br /><br />1) GIS Technician - low end on pay and required education. perform routine technical tasks using GIS software.<br /><br />2) GIS Analyst - technical, but higher pay and higher required education. most GIS jobs out there fall into this category... but no two analysts do the same thing, have same skills, make same money. quite a wide range out there.<br /><br />3) GIS Manager - you manage people that do jobs 1, 2, and 4. To get such a position, you probably did job 1, 2, or 4 previously, or you have experience managing people in some other technical field. You make more money simply because you are a manager. You won't enter into this position right out of school most likely.<br /><br />4) GIS Developer  - like 2) but more technical.  You develop in C# or <a href="http://vb.net/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">VB.NET</span></a> or Java for example. You have a background or skill in computer software development. You make more money generally because there are fewer of  you out there (people that know both GIS and software development). You develop custom or homegrown applications that make GIS do something specific. As an example, a county government uses GIS to manage tax parcels. They have a custom GIS application that does this. Some GIS developers build and maintain this for them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;">Application fields</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;"><br /><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">GIS careers are not limited to the envionmental field at all. All of the positions I described above exist in scores of different fields. As a GIS career professional, (hey that has a nice ring to it)!, you or your company/department may specialize in one field, or you may work for a GIS consulting firm that does work in a number of fields.<br /><br />Some fields off the top of my head:<br />   -Environmental<br />   -Oil and natural gas exploration - Right now, in some cities (e.g. <st1:city st="on">Houston</st1:city>, <st1:city st="on">Denver</st1:city>, <st1:city st="on"><st1:place st="on">Calgary</st1:place></st1:city>) there are tons and tons of jobs in oil and gas GIS, and, as you know, these companies have money (business goes up and down with oil price) .<br />   -Mineral exploration - another field where there is a lot of money and things go up and down a lot.<br />   -Public utilities including electrical, gas, water - GIS is used to manage systems and sometimes design new parts of systems.<br />   -Demographics/marketing - some overlap with advertising, also tons of GIS jobs working for US Census<br />   -Defense - thousands of jobs in <st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Washington</st1:city> <st1:state st="on">DC</st1:state></st1:place> and elsewhere working for government and defense contractors.<br />   -Transportation - e.g. state department of transportation<br />   -Emergency 911<br />   -Cadastral (tax and property) mapping<br />   -Advertising<br />   -Facilities management<br />   -IT - information technology. This is a broader field than GIS, but sometimes GIS is integrated with other business systems.<br />   -Engineering - some overlap with CAD in this field, GIS is used to both design new infastructure and manage existing infastructure. Think also what is happening in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<br />   -Health - epidemiology, pretty interesting field with lots of geographic data.<br />   -Aviation and navigation - charts for planes and boat<br />   -Agriculture and precision farming<br /><br /><b>Related technologies/careers</b><br /><br />Some related technologies/fields where a GIS background may be useful include GPS and navigation systems. These are used on construction sites, in cars, in airplanes, in golf bags on the course to geolocate your position! Also, any skill/experience/education with computer software, hardware, web stuff can certainly be combined with GIS. Lots of GIS is "online" now.<br /><br />Especially in the environmental and engineering fields, your GIS career may overlap quite a bit with a civil/environmental engineering career.<br /><br /><b>Where to search for jobs</b><br /><br />"GIS" turns up a ton of jobs on <a href="http://monster.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Monster.com </span></a>, and <a href="http://www.gjc.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">http://www.gjc.org/</span></a> is a great site with only GIS jobs.

I would advise getting real-world experience. Employers value real-world experience. It can be hard to get, but I would try and get your foot in the door wherever you can. Take an internship-type or even trial position if someone gives it to you.<br /><br />Get technical experience. If you find software programming interesting, get more experience with .NET language (for desktop or web development) or Java (for web development).<br /><br />Network. Definitely work through your university contacts, professors, fellow students, alums.<br /><br />Keep up to date. There are some great GIS blogs out there.  Read every day and you'll know what's going on.<br /><br />Do some research on salaries. GIS is a young field. There is such a range of salaries. In general, GIS people still don't get paid equivalent to others in IT. I think that this will change, but like anything you have to prove you deserve it. Some fields (oil, gas) pay more than others (environmental).<br /><br />If you are interested, think about taking a position that may involve field work, such as collecting data in the summertime via GPS.

He had the requirement to make an entire line or polygon dataset a factor larger or smaller. e.g. scale the dataset by a factor of 5.<br /><br /><strong>Mathematical Solution</strong><br /><br />I knew that matrix algebra might help us here. I did some web research and confirmed that you can scale a 2d point by taking a matrix that looks like this (x and y are the scale factors in the x and y dimensions)...<br /><br />x 0 0<br />0 y 0<br />0 0 1<br /><br />...and multiplying by your point, which looks like this...<br /><br />x1<br />y1<br />1<br /><br />Here are some good links on matrix algebra:<br /><br /><a href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~mrmeanie/matrix/matrices.htm">http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~mrmeanie/matrix/matrices.htm</a> (background)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.engineering.usu.edu/cee/faculty/gurro/Classes/Classes_Spring2002/VBGradClass/VBGradClass.htm">http://www.engineering.usu.edu/cee/faculty/gurro/Classes/Classes_Spring2002/VBGradClass/VBGradClass.htm</a> (includes vb code sample to multiply two matrices)<br /><br /><strong>Coding a Solution</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />I coded a solution in VBA to do this scaling on a shapefile. My goal was to mimic the 'dataset scaling' function described above, and that I'm also told that Manifold GIS provides. I didn't end up using the vb code mentioned above to multiply two matrices, but I did use matrix algebra indirectly.<br /><br />A few important observations:<br /><br />1) I found it necessary to first introduce a false origin at the lower left of the original dataset before performing the scaling. Easy way to do this, determine lower left coordinates and subtract from all point coordinates.<br /><br />2) Scaling was straightforward. Just multiple all x coords by x scale factor and all y coords by y scale factor. In my case, the x and y scale factors were equal.<br /><br />3) Now my dataset is larger, but where is it? Well, it's anchored to the lower left of the orginal dataset. The Manifold functionality centers the new dataset on the old. So, based on the x and y extents of the orig and scaled dataset, I calculated the distance that I needed to move my scaled dataset "down and to the left" (to use the a technical term ; ), then I achieved this using simple subraction on my x and y coordinates.<br /><br />4) Finally, don't forget to "undo" the false origin set in step 1). Do this by adding back in the dataset lower left x and y coordinates that were subtracted in step 1).<br /><br />There you have it, how to scale a dataset and recenter it on the original dataset.<br /><br />VBA code is <a href="http://www.eicher-gis.com/ArcObjects/DatasetScaling_Example.htm">here</a>.<br /><br /><strong>News</strong><br /><br />I also have some professional news. I've accepted a position to work for ESRI Switzerland in Zurich. I'll be working on projects there mostly related to cartography and ArcGIS. I'm very excited about the position and the move.

I did some web research and confirmed that you can scale a 2d point by taking a matrix that looks like this (x and y are the scale factors in the x and y dimensions)...<br /><br />x 0 0<br />0 y 0<br />0 0 1<br /><br />...and multiplying by your point, which looks like this...<br /><br />x1<br />y1<br />1<br /><br />Here are some good links on matrix algebra:<br /><br /><a href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~mrmeanie/matrix/matrices.htm">http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~mrmeanie/matrix/matrices.htm</a> (background)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.engineering.usu.edu/cee/faculty/gurro/Classes/Classes_Spring2002/VBGradClass/VBGradClass.htm">http://www.engineering.usu.edu/cee/faculty/gurro/Classes/Classes_Spring2002/VBGradClass/VBGradClass.htm</a> (includes vb code sample to multiply two matrices)<br /><br /><strong>Coding a Solution</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />I coded a solution in VBA to do this scaling on a shapefile. My goal was to mimic the 'dataset scaling' function described above, and that I'm also told that Manifold GIS provides. I didn't end up using the vb code mentioned above to multiply two matrices, but I did use matrix algebra indirectly.<br /><br />A few important observations:<br /><br />1) I found it necessary to first introduce a false origin at the lower left of the original dataset before performing the scaling. Easy way to do this, determine lower left coordinates and subtract from all point coordinates.<br /><br />2) Scaling was straightforward. Just multiple all x coords by x scale factor and all y coords by y scale factor. In my case, the x and y scale factors were equal.<br /><br />3) Now my dataset is larger, but where is it? Well, it's anchored to the lower left of the orginal dataset. The Manifold functionality centers the new dataset on the old. So, based on the x and y extents of the orig and scaled dataset, I calculated the distance that I needed to move my scaled dataset "down and to the left" (to use the a technical term ; ), then I achieved this using simple subraction on my x and y coordinates.<br /><br />4) Finally, don't forget to "undo" the false origin set in step 1). Do this by adding back in the dataset lower left x and y coordinates that were subtracted in step 1).<br /><br />There you have it, how to scale a dataset and recenter it on the original dataset.<br /><br />VBA code is <a href="http://www.eicher-gis.com/ArcObjects/DatasetScaling_Example.htm">here</a>.<br /><br /><strong>News</strong><br /><br />I also have some professional news. I've accepted a position to work for ESRI Switzerland in Zurich. I'll be working on projects there mostly related to cartography and ArcGIS. I'm very excited about the position and the move.

IFeature.Delete is generally the slowest since it happens for each feature."<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE</strong>: - After trying to implement MC's suggestion to use buffering in combination with IFeatureCursor.DeleteFeature, I had to ask him a follow up question: How exactly do you do this? I couldn't see a way to do this through the API. Well, it turns out that this is done behind the scenes for you. When you use IFeatureCursor.DeleteFeature, the cursor is flushed every 100 features or so...<br />-Cory (5/26/06)<br /><strong>C</strong> - "Great, thanks."<br /><br />Talk to you soon,<br /><br />-Cory</div>";}i:6;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:67:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/21845286/posts/full/114381336444158533";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Fri, 31 Mar 2006 13:10:00 +0000";s:4:"atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-04-03T17:13:04.320+02:00";}s:5:"title";s:64:"Comparing the Cartography of Google Maps and Ask.com Maps Part 2";s:11:"description";s:3584:"<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It's been awhile since I've posted.

You had to get to all the .NET sessions early or you were stuck standing or sitting on the floor.</li><li>One thing I always see a lot in web demos of ESRI technology... bad maps. Okay, I'm a cartographer, but in this session I saw fusing of multiple services on same map... Map was unprojected/geographic, and in Canada, rivers were shown, but the other layers were missing. When I was at ESRI we were careful to create attractive maps for demos (okay, were were demoing carto fucntionality) , but we were also careful to be inclusive of non-US audiences.

First off, are your NCAA brackets looking? I'm sitting right at the 80th percentile in Yahoo, a solid B-...<br /><br />A few quick notes from yesterday:<br /><br /><strong>AM Keynote</strong><br /><ul><li>Not an overwhelming success, but not a dud either. The start was a bit awkward, as if because it's the first year for this, ESRI themselves didn't know how to kick things off. I'm glad that they basically jumped right in.</li><li>Scott Morehouse talked about how ArcGIS is architected. He focused a lot on frameworks. I focused on the fact that as a former ESRI employee I used to get paid to hear Scott talk, but now as a conference attendee, I'm the one paying.</li><li>About a 1/2 hour into the session, I took a look around the room and thought to myself that there were a lot of people there. I don't know, 600-700 people perhaps?</li><li>ESRI announced that 9.2 will support a type of non-versioned, short transaction geodatabase editing model. This to meet the needs of a lot of users that can't embrace long transactions and versioning for a variety of reasons.</li><li>ESRI is the geodatabase. Really, this is the first fucntional area that Scott dove into detail on yesterday, and I've also noticed that it's the one area of the software that has something substantially new each release of ArcGIS.</li><li>About 1 hour into the session I took a look around the room and thought to myself that there were a lot of us males in the audience. </li><li>I noticed some new faces on the stage, and some new roles. Clint Brown talked about the geodatabase, and ESRI are now calling their product specialists 'product engineers'.</li><li>ESRI was definitely pushing geoprocessing. It was used as example of how to reuse components from different types of ArcGIS deployments (desktop, engine, server).</li><li>ESRI demo'd a lot of what's coming in 9.2. I noticed that the audience wasn't really applauding at all after the demos, up until when Ishmael demo'd ArcGIS Explorer. I think ESRI saved the best for last with this. I thought that his demos were pretty interesting, and with the crowd applauding, I think that they agreed with me.</li><li>I came away from the session wondering how many people 'get' all of the various deployment possibilities with ArcGIS. I know that I'm a little bit dizzied by all the options.

First off, are your NCAA brackets looking? I'm sitting right at the 80th percentile in Yahoo, a solid B-...<br /><br />A few quick notes from yesterday:<br /><br /><strong>AM Keynote</strong><br /><ul><li>Not an overwhelming success, but not a dud either. The start was a bit awkward, as if because it's the first year for this, ESRI themselves didn't know how to kick things off. I'm glad that they basically jumped right in.</li><li>Scott Morehouse talked about how ArcGIS is architected. He focused a lot on frameworks. I focused on the fact that as a former ESRI employee I used to get paid to hear Scott talk, but now as a conference attendee, I'm the one paying.</li><li>About a 1/2 hour into the session, I took a look around the room and thought to myself that there were a lot of people there. I don't know, 600-700 people perhaps?</li><li>ESRI announced that 9.2 will support a type of non-versioned, short transaction geodatabase editing model. This to meet the needs of a lot of users that can't embrace long transactions and versioning for a variety of reasons.</li><li>ESRI is the geodatabase. Really, this is the first fucntional area that Scott dove into detail on yesterday, and I've also noticed that it's the one area of the software that has something substantially new each release of ArcGIS.</li><li>About 1 hour into the session I took a look around the room and thought to myself that there were a lot of us males in the audience. </li><li>I noticed some new faces on the stage, and some new roles. Clint Brown talked about the geodatabase, and ESRI are now calling their product specialists 'product engineers'.</li><li>ESRI was definitely pushing geoprocessing. It was used as example of how to reuse components from different types of ArcGIS deployments (desktop, engine, server).</li><li>ESRI demo'd a lot of what's coming in 9.2. I noticed that the audience wasn't really applauding at all after the demos, up until when Ishmael demo'd ArcGIS Explorer. I think ESRI saved the best for last with this. I thought that his demos were pretty interesting, and with the crowd applauding, I think that they agreed with me.</li><li>I came away from the session wondering how many people 'get' all of the various deployment possibilities with ArcGIS. I know that I'm a little bit dizzied by all the options. I was also excited to see the PM session where they'd be demoing the new Flash stuff.</li></ul><p><strong>Technical Sessions</strong></p><ul><li>I attended Al LaFramboise's session on developing components that work in different ArcGIS products (desktop/engine/server).

Helpful people that they are, they knew that I'm looking for ideas for my blog. So, for this entry, I'll piggy-back a bit on James' post.<br /><br /><strong>Color Brewer<br /></strong>First, a great online resource for cartography that everyone should know about is Color Brewer (<a href="http://www.colorbrewer.org">www.colorbrewer.org</a>). This site was created by Dr. Cindy Brewer and Dr. Mark Harrower both cartographers, and this is the place to go online if you're not sure about what colors to use on your maps... and believe me, you're not sure about what colors to use on your maps! The site can basically be used as a "map colorer", telling you which colors/schemes to use for different types of maps and data.<br /><br /><strong>Evolution of cartographic facilities in GIS Software </strong><br />Yes, there's some exciting new functionality coming in 9.2 for cartography. Admittedly I'm a bit biased since I knew this stuff from inside ESRI, but perhaps I'll do some more convincing for your here.<br /><br />9.2 cartographic representations allow you to edit feature symbology on a feature by feature basis. Pretty powerful as you can imagine for cartographers, but also as ESRI's Paul Hardy likes to say, for people that "just want a better map". Oh, and please don't forget the database! Symbology edits are stored in the geodatabase together with the feature data. Have you been waiting for ESRI to store .lyr/.mxd information in a database? Well, this is the first step...<br /><br />Is 9.2 the beginning of better cartography from a GIS software package...? Of course not. Sticking with ESRI products, I'd say that a lot started with the ArcView 1x/2x/3x packages. In my opinion, GUI-based software can, and I emphasize _can_, produce better maps. Sure, people got by with ArcPlot, but GUI-based software a) makes "trial and error" easier (although I wouldn't recommend trial and error printing to large format printers when you're footing the paper/ink bill...), and b) GUI-sofware tends to be more WYSIWYG than say, creating maps from a command line app. 9.2 cartographic representations (call 'em reps for short) extend WYSIWYG capabilities in ArcMap by providing the ability to edit symbology.<br /><br />9.2 cartographic representations aren't just editable symbology, they also employ better "automated routines"... (think better symbols). With reps, your maps can have better dashed lines, you'll have more control over the placement of symbols along lines, etc... Cartographers will eat this up, probably starting at the "top". What I mean by this is, organizations that have really strict cartographic requirements will be the first set of users attracted to this functionality. But, the usefullness of reps will have their use trickle down to many, many users...<br /><br /><strong>A New Editing Paradigm?</strong><br />Ah yes, <em>paradigm</em>, the word that I, the engineer, heard but wasn't quite sure how to spell during the first weeks of my graduate education in geography. 9.2 also provides new representation editings tools. Simplifying things greatly, these tools are "illustrator-like" allowing you do do things that just aren't very easy using the standard arcmap edit tools... such as modifying multiple features at once. Cartographers need to do this all the time (think offsetting several road line segments from a creek or river) and they don't want to think about topology when they do it, at least not in the sense that this is necessary in the pre 9.2 ArcMap editing experience.<br /><br />Depending on how 9.2 reps are received by the public, in my opinion, their usability could spell big changes for the data-editing experience in ArcGIS... There are rumors of a huge change to the look/feel/architecture of arcgis at the next major release (10.0?). A big change to editing could be part of this.<br /><br /><strong>Understanding Cartographic Representations</strong><br />Are cartographic representations hard to understand? My answer is, yes, er.. possibly. <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2005/07/25/cartography-in-arcgis-9/">James' UC blog post</a> suggested that reps might be hard to "get", and I know that even big ESRI customers that use ArcGIS for cartography want more detailed information about how they can best use this new technology.<br /><br /><strong>The Devil is in the Data</strong><br />Like a lot of other things, when you need to do a lot of something with GIS, and do it often (such as produce a lot of maps, and produce frequent updates to these maps), it helps: a) to have your data in a database -- hopefully the ESRI geodatabase ; ), b) to have well modeled data, and c) to have well defined processes for creating and updating your data.<br /><br />My experience with dealing with organizations that produce a lot of maps from GIS is that, well, most of their work isn't in the cartography, it's in dealing with the data... I'd postulate that this is pretty universal, whether you're producing maps, or performing watershed analyses, it helps to have a), b), and c) in pretty good order.<br /><br /><strong>Design is Important</strong><br />Design will always be important in cartography. It's no secret that most cartographers would like to see better maps than what we're currently seeing. Some of us (not me certainly) are like film critics: we'll tell you what we like and what we don't like, but we probably won't be able to (or won't want to?) tell you how to get there from the start.<br /><br />The evolution of tools for cartography in ArcMap offers the promise for "better maps", but everybody knows that the ArcGIS 9.x Geoprocessing tools/environment didn't immediately start producing better glaciation models or better site selection analyses... I'd say that the same goes for new 9.2 cartography tools. There's potential for better maps, but resources (online, as James mentioned) and I'd add software documention and even software defaults, are needed to help end users benefit the most from new functionality...<br /><br />... after all, anyone that's worked with the ArcView 3x technology has problably seen the, well, hideous jagged lines that appear by default in ArcView legends. Not to pick on anyone, but here's an <a href="http://users.mhc.edu/facultystaff/spearson/safc/pub_lnds.gif">example</a>. The problem is that that this "toppled Z" symbol is the default legend pattern in the software, and not than many people change software defaults. One consequence of this is that you can still peg an ArcView 3x map simply by the appearance of lines in the legend.<br /><br />Talk to you soon,<br /><br />-Cory</div>";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://www.eicher-gis.com/Blog/2006/02/cartography-in-gis-its-not-just.html";s:6:"author";s:11:"Cory Eicher";s:7:"summary";s:6900:"<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I saw that James just posted about <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2006/02/23/cartography-and-arcmap/">Cartography and ArcMap </a>... actually, before I even saw it, a few colleagues emailed me to tell me that they saw it.

Sticking with ESRI products, I'd say that a lot started with the ArcView 1x/2x/3x packages. In my opinion, GUI-based software can, and I emphasize _can_, produce better maps. Sure, people got by with ArcPlot, but GUI-based software a) makes "trial and error" easier (although I wouldn't recommend trial and error printing to large format printers when you're footing the paper/ink bill...), and b) GUI-sofware tends to be more WYSIWYG than say, creating maps from a command line app. 9.2 cartographic representations (call 'em reps for short) extend WYSIWYG capabilities in ArcMap by providing the ability to edit symbology.<br /><br />9.2 cartographic representations aren't just editable symbology, they also employ better "automated routines"... (think better symbols). With reps, your maps can have better dashed lines, you'll have more control over the placement of symbols along lines, etc... Cartographers will eat this up, probably starting at the "top". What I mean by this is, organizations that have really strict cartographic requirements will be the first set of users attracted to this functionality. But, the usefullness of reps will have their use trickle down to many, many users...<br /><br /><strong>A New Editing Paradigm?</strong><br />Ah yes, <em>paradigm</em>, the word that I, the engineer, heard but wasn't quite sure how to spell during the first weeks of my graduate education in geography. 9.2 also provides new representation editings tools. Simplifying things greatly, these tools are "illustrator-like" allowing you do do things that just aren't very easy using the standard arcmap edit tools... such as modifying multiple features at once. Cartographers need to do this all the time (think offsetting several road line segments from a creek or river) and they don't want to think about topology when they do it, at least not in the sense that this is necessary in the pre 9.2 ArcMap editing experience.<br /><br />Depending on how 9.2 reps are received by the public, in my opinion, their usability could spell big changes for the data-editing experience in ArcGIS... There are rumors of a huge change to the look/feel/architecture of arcgis at the next major release (10.0?). A big change to editing could be part of this.<br /><br /><strong>Understanding Cartographic Representations</strong><br />Are cartographic representations hard to understand? My answer is, yes, er.. possibly. <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2005/07/25/cartography-in-arcgis-9/">James' UC blog post</a> suggested that reps might be hard to "get", and I know that even big ESRI customers that use ArcGIS for cartography want more detailed information about how they can best use this new technology.<br /><br /><strong>The Devil is in the Data</strong><br />Like a lot of other things, when you need to do a lot of something with GIS, and do it often (such as produce a lot of maps, and produce frequent updates to these maps), it helps: a) to have your data in a database -- hopefully the ESRI geodatabase ; ), b) to have well modeled data, and c) to have well defined processes for creating and updating your data.<br /><br />My experience with dealing with organizations that produce a lot of maps from GIS is that, well, most of their work isn't in the cartography, it's in dealing with the data... I'd postulate that this is pretty universal, whether you're producing maps, or performing watershed analyses, it helps to have a), b), and c) in pretty good order.<br /><br /><strong>Design is Important</strong><br />Design will always be important in cartography. It's no secret that most cartographers would like to see better maps than what we're currently seeing. Some of us (not me certainly) are like film critics: we'll tell you what we like and what we don't like, but we probably won't be able to (or won't want to?) tell you how to get there from the start.<br /><br />The evolution of tools for cartography in ArcMap offers the promise for "better maps", but everybody knows that the ArcGIS 9.x Geoprocessing tools/environment didn't immediately start producing better glaciation models or better site selection analyses... I'd say that the same goes for new 9.2 cartography tools. There's potential for better maps, but resources (online, as James mentioned) and I'd add software documention and even software defaults, are needed to help end users benefit the most from new functionality...<br /><br />... after all, anyone that's worked with the ArcView 3x technology has problably seen the, well, hideous jagged lines that appear by default in ArcView legends. Not to pick on anyone, but here's an <a href="http://users.mhc.edu/facultystaff/spearson/safc/pub_lnds.gif">example</a>. The problem is that that this "toppled Z" symbol is the default legend pattern in the software, and not than many people change software defaults. One consequence of this is that you can still peg an ArcView 3x map simply by the appearance of lines in the legend.<br /><br />Talk to you soon,<br /><br />-Cory</div>";}i:12;a:8:{s:4:"guid";s:67:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/21845286/posts/full/114062598938737861";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 22 Feb 2006 16:28:00 +0000";s:4:"atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-02-22T17:35:30.670+01:00";}s:5:"title";s:25:"1 if ByRef, 2 if ByVal...";s:11:"description";s:3116:"<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>ArcGIS Explorer</strong><br /><strong></strong><ul><li>ESRI has posted an FAQ here: <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/about/faqs.html">ArcGIS Explorer FAQ</a></li><li>If you have ArcGIS 9.2 beta (I don't), then you have ArcGIS Explorer.
