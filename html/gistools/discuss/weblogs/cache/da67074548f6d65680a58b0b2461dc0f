The integration of sensors in one device, no additional accessory needed, will bring to the market a new area of apps, from gaming to professional applications. The games with augmented reality are already bringing a new dimension to the experience. I believe that shopping experiences will be completely transformed.

The game launched in early 2014, and began to gain steam in February. Using Sudoku-like mechanics and Candy Crush-style matching, &quot;Threes&quot; involves matching up multiples of threes for higher scores.</p><p>However, &quot;Threes&quot; was a paid game at $1.99, which meant there was room for another, perhaps less scrupulous developer, to come in and fill a gap by addressing a free-to-play audience. And so one did. &quot;1024&quot; quickly emerged, effectively ripping off &quot;Threes,&quot; even directly referencing the hit game it copied in its App Store description, saying: &quot;No need to pay for ThreesGames. This is a simple and fun gift for you, and it's free.&quot;</p><p>According to the 2014 IDG Enterprise CITE survey published today, Windows 7 is still ubiquitous at work: 51% of respondents said their companies are buying new devices with the nearly five-year-old OS and another 42% support existing devices, for a total of 93%. iOS 7 is supported by 72%, even though it's less than six months old, and the almost thirteen-year-old Windows XP is supported by 66%. Shockingly 10% of technology buyers surveyed in November and December 2013 said their companies were still buying Windows XP on new computers, even though support expires in April 2014.</p><p>In a switch that amounts to heresy among some techies, I've become a two-screen sceptic.

The Nokia 7280 phone was a dubbed the &quot;the lipstick phone,&quot; and while it was not necessarily geared for women, its name - along with it having no number pad - did not attract customers.</p><p>Similarly, the Rong Zun 758 Razor Phone, was - as the name suggests - a phone that had a razor at the bottom edge of the device, perfect for a quick shave before an important call.</p><p>Olivier Taillieu, an attorney for Typo, said BlackBerry is trying to monopolize the keyboard market and many keyboards have the design characteristics that the smartphone maker is claiming it owns.</p><p>BlackBerry hasn't shown that its mobile phone sales are driven by the popularity of its keyboards, he told [Judge William] Orrick.</p><p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi has received the highest number of complaints from consumers in China among any mobile phone brands, with 993 such instances being reported, followed by Apple at 805 and Samsung with 621 complaints, reports the state-run China News Service, citing a report published by a Chinese product control foundation.</p><p>The foundation stated that it had received 6,497 mobile phone-related complaints in 2013, a 60% growth from the previous year, and which accounted for 12.4% of the total number of complaints received by the industry.</p><p>we are at the very beginning of the next phone and tablet revolution. The integration of sensors in one device, no additional accessory needed, will bring to the market a new area of apps, from gaming to professional applications. The games with augmented reality are already bringing a new dimension to the experience. I believe that shopping experiences will be completely transformed. You could already foresee an IKEA app, where you would &quot;3D&quot; model your existing kitchen with a Tango phone and order a completely new cabinet set online delivered by an IKEA drone?</p><p>This latest clone battle, preparing to best the &quot;Flappy Bird&quot; saga, began with a well-designed, addictive puzzle app called &quot;Threes&quot;&nbsp;from development shop Sirvo (Greg Wohlwend and Asher Vollmer). The game launched in early 2014, and began to gain steam in February. Using Sudoku-like mechanics and Candy Crush-style matching, &quot;Threes&quot; involves matching up multiples of threes for higher scores.</p><p>However, &quot;Threes&quot; was a paid game at $1.99, which meant there was room for another, perhaps less scrupulous developer, to come in and fill a gap by addressing a free-to-play audience. And so one did. &quot;1024&quot; quickly emerged, effectively ripping off &quot;Threes,&quot; even directly referencing the hit game it copied in its App Store description, saying: &quot;No need to pay for ThreesGames. This is a simple and fun gift for you, and it's free.&quot;</p><p>According to the 2014 IDG Enterprise CITE survey published today, Windows 7 is still ubiquitous at work: 51% of respondents said their companies are buying new devices with the nearly five-year-old OS and another 42% support existing devices, for a total of 93%. iOS 7 is supported by 72%, even though it's less than six months old, and the almost thirteen-year-old Windows XP is supported by 66%. Shockingly 10% of technology buyers surveyed in November and December 2013 said their companies were still buying Windows XP on new computers, even though support expires in April 2014.</p><p>In a switch that amounts to heresy among some techies, I've become a two-screen sceptic.

Nadella later changed his mind.</p><p>Discovering relevant content and services within apps has also been a big challenge. Consumers want such a service. As an example, if a consumer is searching for a flight to Las Vegas, in an ideal scenario the phone or discovery service would launch whatever flight booking app is installed on the phone and send the consumer directly to the reservations page. But apps (alongside the content and services in them) can't be crawled. They are not just about index and links, and hence are hard to &quot;page rank.&quot; As a result it is difficult for a search engine to discover apps and offer consumers an entry point.</p><p>Consumer behavior on mobile is very different than the desktop web. The de-facto behavior on the web is to launch the browser to google.com, type a sentence and be re-directed to content. The de-facto behavior in mobile is to launch an app (previously installed on the device) and enjoy the comprehensive experience offered within it. You are rarely, if ever, linked out to a mobile webpage from an app or sent to another app. Each experience is essentially an island unto itself, completely reliant on the consumer to come ashore.</p><p> As befits a debate which is centered on bitcoin, a lot of the incomprehension comes down to trust and faith. Bitcoin is a protocol which requires faith in no individual, institution, or state  all you need to believe in is cryptography. Dorian Nakamoto could have told Goodman explicitly that yes, he invented bitcoin  and still a lot of the bitcoin faithful would not be fully convinced unless and until Dorian proved that assertion cryptographically.</p><p>According to research published by Monetate, a provider of e-commerce solutions, tablets and smartphones accounted for 27% of e-commerce website traffic in Q4 2013, up from 18% in Q4 2012.</p><p>Tablets account for more traffic than smartphones do, and the conversion rate on tablets is much higher than it is on smartphones. The data suggests that tablet users actually make purchases on their device while smartphone users browse products and check prices on the go but turn to bigger devices or actual brick-and-mortar stores to make the purchase.</p><p>One year ago today, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/desktop-computers/windows-8-surge-later-year-what-are-analysts-smoking-213974">IDC predicted</a> &quot;the second half of 2013 [will] regain some marginal momentum partly as a rubber band effect from 2012, and largely thanks to the outcome of industry restructuring, better channel involvement, and potentially greater acceptance of Windows 8.

The freshly restated figures from IDC show a 9.8% decrease in 2013. Somebody missed the boat.

Nadella later changed his mind.</p><p>Discovering relevant content and services within apps has also been a big challenge. Consumers want such a service. As an example, if a consumer is searching for a flight to Las Vegas, in an ideal scenario the phone or discovery service would launch whatever flight booking app is installed on the phone and send the consumer directly to the reservations page. But apps (alongside the content and services in them) can't be crawled. They are not just about index and links, and hence are hard to &quot;page rank.&quot; As a result it is difficult for a search engine to discover apps and offer consumers an entry point.</p><p>Consumer behavior on mobile is very different than the desktop web. The de-facto behavior on the web is to launch the browser to google.com, type a sentence and be re-directed to content. The de-facto behavior in mobile is to launch an app (previously installed on the device) and enjoy the comprehensive experience offered within it. You are rarely, if ever, linked out to a mobile webpage from an app or sent to another app. Each experience is essentially an island unto itself, completely reliant on the consumer to come ashore.</p><p> As befits a debate which is centered on bitcoin, a lot of the incomprehension comes down to trust and faith. Bitcoin is a protocol which requires faith in no individual, institution, or state  all you need to believe in is cryptography. Dorian Nakamoto could have told Goodman explicitly that yes, he invented bitcoin  and still a lot of the bitcoin faithful would not be fully convinced unless and until Dorian proved that assertion cryptographically.</p><p>According to research published by Monetate, a provider of e-commerce solutions, tablets and smartphones accounted for 27% of e-commerce website traffic in Q4 2013, up from 18% in Q4 2012.</p><p>Tablets account for more traffic than smartphones do, and the conversion rate on tablets is much higher than it is on smartphones. The data suggests that tablet users actually make purchases on their device while smartphone users browse products and check prices on the go but turn to bigger devices or actual brick-and-mortar stores to make the purchase.</p><p>One year ago today, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/desktop-computers/windows-8-surge-later-year-what-are-analysts-smoking-213974">IDC predicted</a> &quot;the second half of 2013 [will] regain some marginal momentum partly as a rubber band effect from 2012, and largely thanks to the outcome of industry restructuring, better channel involvement, and potentially greater acceptance of Windows 8. We also anticipate a new refresh cycle momentum in the commercial segment driven by the end of Window XP life support.&quot; At that time, the group changed its prediction for 2013 PC shipments, from an increase of 2.8%, to a decrease of 1.3%. The freshly restated figures from IDC show a 9.8% decrease in 2013. Somebody missed the boat. Hell, they missed a flotilla of boats.</p><p>We're supposed to believe that 2014 shipments will only fall 6 percent? Pshaw. Somebody needs a wakeup call.</p>";s:12:"atom_content";s:1:"
