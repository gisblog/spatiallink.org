<br />

<br />
FOSS4G is the premier conference for the open source geospatial community, providing a place for developers, users, and people new to open source geospatial to get a full-immersion experience in both established and leading edge geospatial technologies.
<br />

<br />
This is your chance to showcase your favorite application, integration solution, or other topic. You will use your superior classroom skills to lead a group of attendees through your chosen topic in either a half-day or ninety minute lab or classroom format. Half-day workshops will be delivered on Monday, September 24 (the Workshops day), while the ninety minute workshops will run concurrently with the presentations during the remainder of the conference.
<br />

<br />
While we are open to workshops on a wide range of topics, we strongly encourage workshop submissions on the following topics:
<br />

<br />
* Practical Introduction to _
<br />
* Interoperability
<br />
* NeoGeography and NovelGeography
<br />
* Using a Software Stack
<br />
* 3D Worlds
<br />

<br />
In the tradition of previous FOSS4G events, we expect that the majority of workshops will be "hands on", with participants seated in front of computers and able to follow along with the instructor, working directly with the software and applications under discussion.
<br />

<br />
Be prepared to spend considerable effort in creating your workshop. Past experience has shown that a high quality workshop requires about three days of preparation for each hour of presentation time. As part of this preparation you will be expected to develop material for attendees to take away with them, such as handouts, a 'workbook', CDROM, etc.
<br />

<br />
In recognition of this effort, workshop presenters will receive a reduction in the price of conference registration:
<br />

<br />
* Free registration for delivering a half-day workshop
<br />
* Half-price registration for delivering a 90-minute workshop
<br />

<br />
And because of limited space, you may want to consider submitting two versions of your topic, one for each length format.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
In the Summer 2006 edition of Economic Development Journal, Joseph A. Marinucci, FM, the chairman of IEDC's Board of Directors during FY 2006, recognized the support that <a href="http://www.eda.gov/" target="_blank" class="postlink">EDA</a> has provided to IEDC's Economic Recovery Volunteer Program. Below is an excerpt from his letter to Journal readers: 
<br />

<br />
[IEDC] launched the Economic Recovery Volunteer Program in December through the support of an Economic Development Administration [EDA] grant. The program deploys skilled IEDC members to economic development organizations located in areas that suffered heavy damage from the hurricanes. The volunteer program's objective is to increase the post-disaster survival rate of small and medium sized businesses, provide professional assistance to economic development organizations, and support the long-term recovery and development of regional economies. Phase I went through June 2006. 
<br />

<br />
Between December 2005 and June 2006, 52 volunteers from across the nation were sent to seven locations in southern Louisiana and Mississippi. Volunteers contributed a collective 313 days of service, and the program generated a total of $164,450 in-kind funding through contributions from IEDC volunteers and IEDC staff time. Key volunteer activities and impacts included individual counseling to nearly 200 businesses; grant writing assistance resulting in grant proposals totaling $680 million for reinvestment projects in the New Orleans region; economic recovery strategic plans, programs, and proposals for local economies; and an off-site resource database and communications systems to ensure project continuity. 
<br />

<br />
IEDC has recently been awarded a second grant from EDA to continue this successful program. In this second phase, we aim to expand the Volunteer Program and send another 100 volunteers to the Gulf Coast. You too can participate in this renewed effort. Go to the IEDC website to learn more. The organization's many initiatives have each served as a step towards Gulf Coast recovery. Today, IEDC continues to assist communities and organizations as they plan for and initiate the long-term rebuilding of their economies.

<br />

<br />
Columbus, OH— Digital Data Technologies, Inc. (DDTI®) launches today the free download of its AccuGlobe® Desktop 2007 software <a href="http://www.ddti.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>.  DDTI distributed beta versions of the program to clients attending its annual Users’ Group Conference last month.
<br />

<br />
“I am so impressed with AccuGlobe 2007.  It was already a really user-friendly program, but now the added features have made my job so much easier,” said Holmes County GIS Director Erik Parker.  “I love that 2007 allows me to reproject my map layers on the fly so I don’t have to bother with manually reconfiguring my projects.”
<br />

<br />
Other new editing features include an undo/redo feature and the ability to modify multiple layers at the same time.  Users can create shortcuts to frequent views with a new Hotspots feature, eliminating repeated zooming and panning to find the ideal frame.  AccuGlobe Desktop 2007 also supports new data formats including ECW and JPEG2000.
<br />

<br />
“I recently attended DDTI's annual user group conference and once again DDTI has hit one out of the park.  What most impresses me about DDTI is their ability to strive to make their products and services exceed their clients’ needs,” said Erie County GIS Coordinator Mark Wroblewski.  “AccuGlobe 2007 and the other applications that DDTI is developing are providing the solutions that allow local government to work together and maximize our resources, which results in cost savings for all the participants.  Erie County is making great strides thanks to DDTI."
<br />

<br />
While its users have raved over the many new features, one change that goes undetected is the engine behind the application. 
<br />

<br />
“When we developed AccuGlobe 2004, we collaborated with a third-party agency, so the nuts and bolts of application weren’t entirely our own,” said DDTI Partner and Chief Software Developer Chris Santer.  “We knew we wanted to change that for this upgrade, and are thrilled that Desktop 2007 runs solely on DDTI-developed programming.  Our team of developers and programmers has done a great job building the foundation for this upgrade, and we’re excited to release our efforts to the GIS community.”
<br />

<br />
DDTI’s existing base of more than 25,000 AccuGlobe 2004 users will enjoy the flexibility of installing AccuGlobe Desktop 2007 on the same computer as AccuGlobe 2004.  However, in order to download the upgrade, users must follow the step-by-step process.  AccuGlobe 2004’s convenient built-in web updater function will not achieve the program upgrade; instead, it will simply offer the latest version of 2004.  Users who participated in the AccuGlobe Desktop 2007 preview also need to download, rather than running the web updater.
<br />

<br />
Users must operate on Windows 2000 or XP platforms in order to run the AccuGlobe upgrade, and should run setup.exe after the initial download.  Like its predecessor, AccuGlobe Desktop 2007 also features a web updater function, which users should run upon installation to obtain the most recent version.
<br />

<br />
All inquiries for assistance with AccuGlobe Desktop 2007 should be directed to DDTI’s <a href="http://forums.ddti.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">online community forum</a>.
