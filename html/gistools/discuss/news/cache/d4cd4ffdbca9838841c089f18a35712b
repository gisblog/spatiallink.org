<p>Properly speaking, Nadav Rotem's <a href="http://libots.sourceforge.net/">Open Text Summarizer</a> (OTS) is not a summarizer at all. True summaries generally involve rewording contents at a higher level of generality while preserving the meaning, not just producing a condensed version of the original the way that OTS does. However, within its limits, OTS is an efficient tool for automatically producing abstracts of non-fiction, that, in the last 15 months, has received favorable mention from at least four academic publications, including one in which it outperformed similar utilities, including commercial ones such as <a href="http://www.copernic.com/">Copernic</a> and <a href="http://www.kryltech.com/summarizer.htm">Subject Search Summarizer</a>.</p>";}}s:7:"channel";a:7:{s:5:"title";s:21:"Linux.com :: Features";s:4:"link";s:28:"http://www.linux.com/feature";s:11:"description";s:32:"Everything Linux and Open Source";s:2:"dc";a:2:{s:8:"language";s:5:"en-us";s:7:"creator";s:15:"Linux.com Admin";}s:2:"sy";a:2:{s:12:"updateperiod";s:6:"hourly";s:15:"updatefrequency";s:1:"1";}s:4:"docs";s:31:"http://backend.userland.com/rss";s:7:"tagline";s:32:"Everything Linux and Open Source";}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:0:{}s:9:"feed_type";s:3:"RSS";s:12:"feed_version";s:3:"2.0";s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:13:"current_field";s:0:"";s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:4:"etag";s:44:"dcbd5041fd9fb4b8a6b00535a605bc561236096545
