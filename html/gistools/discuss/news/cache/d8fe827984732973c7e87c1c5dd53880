While the housing and bank crises have undeniably impacted the global markets, a recent study of European retail reveals that there are still areas of growth and untapped potential. Sales area productivity and per capita sales area are two of the key benchmarks when it comes to assessing retail performance. This article provides a spatial analysis of the relevant data to reveal significant differences in these values across the continent.

Given the dollars at stake, it is not surprising that many technology firms are now promoting point-level Solvency II solutions. Insurance companies would also be served by building up and enhancing their core GIS capabilities, especially in the areas of data quality, geocoding, data enrichment and predictive analytics. In this way - they can not only comply with Solvency II requirements in the most cost-efficient manner they can actually improve their overall business operations.

The GTCM acts as a blueprint for educators within higher education to develop curricula for certificates and degrees in GIS, and for companies looking to hire capable geospatial technologists that must match the skills of the potential employee with the critical job functions of the employer. But there seems to be a disconnect between the high profile of geospatial technology in Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration's domain and the U.S. Department of Education (DoE) which is failing to fund geography education in the next round of reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), also known as No Child Left Behind.
