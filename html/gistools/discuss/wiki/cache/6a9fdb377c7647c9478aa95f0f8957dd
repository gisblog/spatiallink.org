Gothenburg relied on a complex Computer-Aided Design (CAD) system that precluded all but highly trained engineers from using it for GIS purposes. To better serve citizens, businesses, and lower its costs, the city needed a simpler, more extensible GIS solution. Gothenburg deployed a centralized GIS solution based on MapInfo's SpatialWare technology. Augmented by MapInfo intranet and Internet mapping software, the solution is used citywide by departments, authorities, residents, and companies, and expedites planning and services while bolstering safety and lowering costs.";s:7:"summary";s:687:"Sweden's largest trading gateway, Gothenburg has been a robust center of commerce since its founding in 1621.
