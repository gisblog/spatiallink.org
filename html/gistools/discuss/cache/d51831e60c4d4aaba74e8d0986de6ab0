One barrier we keep coming up against, is our ability to geocode addresses or postal codes a-la <a href="http://geocoder.us/">geocoder.us</a>.

Yet the ownership of this data set is obscured - some way between the Ordnance Survey, and the Post Office or Royal Mail as it is now known.

...We just <u>have</u> all kinds of people.<p>

Clearly that is advice to live by.  I wanted a new server to throw 
into our 1/4 rack down at Hurricane Electric.  I mean, Schuyler has 
a machine in the rack, and he and I jointly have a machine in the 
rack, but all those beautiful "U's" were sitting empty, forlorn, 
waiting for a machine from me!
<p>
I got a pretty cool 1U case off of EbAy for $46.97.  As near as I can
tell it is a brand new case.  And it included a power supply, and the 
PCI 90 degree adapter.  Screaming deal.
<p>
Of course, for it to be a <i>Testing Range Production</i> there need
to be some arbitary number of <i>freaky weird things</i> that have to
be done.
<p>
First weird thing was that the back cutouts were just a little off 
from my mother board.  But the Dremel tool made reasonably quick 
work of those.  I did shatter three dremel cut off wheels in the 
process, but that is the price of progress.
<p>
<a href="http://mappinghacks.com/pix/index_pix.html"><img src="/pix/D7_04182005/thumbnail/dsc_6744.JPG" align="left"></a>
Next the motherboard I had from my friend Nate had a full sized
heat sink and fan.  Hmmm.  That is not going to fit in the 1U
case.  A little time with the metal cutting band saw and it seems
that I've taken care of that problem.
<p>
Next is the question of drives.  Since Schuyler had an emergency
that required the use of my new 300 gb drive I installed Fedora
Core 3 on an old 6 gb drive.  I had a 250 gb SATA drive, and 
an Adaptec ASH-1205 SATA Connect Serial ATA Card.  I figured it
wouldn't hurt to try, so I installed the mess and after a quick
fdisk and mkfs I amazingly was able to mount the drive.
<p>
Fedora Core 3 recognized the Adaptec ASH-1205 and automatically 
loaded the sata modules.  I was happy.  I don't know if that
would work for the boot partition, but I'm happy right now.
<p>
A side benefit is that this system has an older BIOS, and 
didn't actually appear to recognize the full 300 gb of the other
drive.  I assume that since the sata modules live in user space

Screws and stuff: case and hard drive screws appear to be (mostly?)
6/32.  This means size 6, and 32 threads per inch.  
This is interesting because it turns out that this means if you use
a certain size drill bit you can reliably make holes that match your
screws, and if you use a slightly smaller bit, and a 6/32 tap, you
can make threads that these screws will happily grip.
<p>
And if you can tap threads you have far more options as to where 
you can install things, and even, dare I say, what is possible to 
treat as a computer case...(more to follow).";s:7:"summary";s:3753:"
...We just <u>have</u> all kinds of people.<p>

Clearly that is advice to live by.  I wanted a new server to throw 
into our 1/4 rack down at Hurricane Electric.  I mean, Schuyler has 
a machine in the rack, and he and I jointly have a machine in the 
rack, but all those beautiful "U's" were sitting empty, forlorn, 
waiting for a machine from me!
<p>
I got a pretty cool 1U case off of EbAy for $46.97.  As near as I can
tell it is a brand new case.  And it included a power supply, and the 
PCI 90 degree adapter.  Screaming deal.
<p>
Of course, for it to be a <i>Testing Range Production</i> there need
to be some arbitary number of <i>freaky weird things</i> that have to
be done.
<p>
First weird thing was that the back cutouts were just a little off 
from my mother board.  But the Dremel tool made reasonably quick 
work of those.  I did shatter three dremel cut off wheels in the 
process, but that is the price of progress.
<p>
<a href="http://mappinghacks.com/pix/index_pix.html"><img src="/pix/D7_04182005/thumbnail/dsc_6744.JPG" align="left"></a>
Next the motherboard I had from my friend Nate had a full sized
heat sink and fan.  Hmmm.  That is not going to fit in the 1U
case.  A little time with the metal cutting band saw and it seems
that I've taken care of that problem.
<p>
Next is the question of drives.  Since Schuyler had an emergency
that required the use of my new 300 gb drive I installed Fedora
Core 3 on an old 6 gb drive.  I had a 250 gb SATA drive, and 
an Adaptec ASH-1205 SATA Connect Serial ATA Card.  I figured it
wouldn't hurt to try, so I installed the mess and after a quick
fdisk and mkfs I amazingly was able to mount the drive.
<p>
Fedora Core 3 recognized the Adaptec ASH-1205 and automatically 
loaded the sata modules.  I was happy.  I don't know if that
would work for the boot partition, but I'm happy right now.
<p>
A side benefit is that this system has an older BIOS, and 
didn't actually appear to recognize the full 300 gb of the other
drive.  I assume that since the sata modules live in user space
that the BIOS loses the power to vex in this case.

better, a limited high resolution data set, or a crappy data set with

In their continuing quest to have something to say about everything on the web,

return listing information, along with an address.
<p>
One could refer to this as YACK, Yet Another Category Killer.  Google seems 
to be good at these.  A slightly amusing, albeit I suspect temporary,
aspect of the Google PhoneBook is that they include links to map

is that they link to Yahoo! Maps and MapQuest.  Notice anyone missing?
<p>
Right!  Google Maps isn't in the house.  Another funny thing is that 
it doesn't actually matter that much if you use Yahoo! Maps or MapQuest,
you are getting NAVTEQ data.
<p>
But that isn't very interesting either.  What is interesting is that
you can use the Google PhoneBook to map telephone numbers.  And at 
GMacker.com, 'Where lazy scientists congregate to excorgitate about,'
they've <a href="http://www.gmacker.com/web/content/mapit/mapit.htm">
created a Firefox extension to get driving directions based on
phone numbers</a>.
<p>
It has one UI quirk: you can enter your starting phone number, but 
you have to highlight the destination from a web page.  It also seemed
to take a bit longer to run then seemed necesary.  Which brings up
another point...I'm not completely sure that installing random dodgy 
Firefox extensions is a completely good idea.
<p>
I don't actually _know_ that my browser has been p0wn3d, but 
the plug in was written by "inahg asum" which seems to be an obvious
acronym for 'I Now am having good amusement (you) Silly User (of) Mozilla.'
<p>
(later)
I unpacked the extension and took a look inside.  It appears that the 
extension is a bit of a wrapper to let you select phone numbers, and the
it sends those to a web service running on the gmacker.com web site.
This has some privacy implications in that all your phone numbers 
are belong to gmacker, and stability risks (like, what happens when 
gmacker gets too much traffic?), but it explains why the search 
takes a bit of time.
<P>
But this also reveals a bit about how you can create Firefox extensions

<a href="http://www.layton-graphics.com/">Layton Graphics</a> has released a 
plug in for Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader that lets you georegister a PDF.
This is more or less the same as georeferencing a raster image.

<p>
George Demmy says it best, so I'll just quote his mail to the geowankers list
<blockquote>
Layton Graphics, the company I work for, has released a plug-in to
Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader that makes it possible to georegister a
PDF, after which you can do stuff like display coordinates in
different projections and datums, zoom to coordinates, make
measurements, get the map azimuth of a line, and check the magnetic
declination (via WMM 2005), import data from CSV and shape files,
etc. If your laptop has a GPS, you display where you are on a
GeoPDF. It's free to play with, and the you can temporarily
georegister PDFs in either version.  A fellow employee bought a
panasonic toughbook off ebay for $150, and with a $50 GPS has got
himself a Dusie of system for recording where his bass holes are.
<p>
The plug-in is available at 
<a href="http://www.layton-graphics.com/downloads.html">
http://www.layton-graphics.com/downloads.html</a>. 
We've got a blog in its
infant stages at 
<a href="http://geopdf.blogspot.com"> 
http://geopdf.blogspot.com</a>, 
wherein we're going to
post tips, tricks, and what's going on with the development of the
plug-in.  I work on the geodesy naughty bits. If you've got questions
or concerns fire away.

There are a couple of example maps on the download site, but you can
georegister any PDF, whether it's a map or not. You're probably
familiar with the UT library map collection at
<a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/index.html">http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/index.html</a> -- it's a good place to get
PDF maps and JPEGs easily converted to PDF, and then to GeoPDF.

One of the more interesting bits of information from that post is that Toughbooks
are available on ebay for $150.  Those are great computers.  I remember Matt Westervelt and Terry talking about their Toughbook fights when we were at  Etech in 2002...any computer you can fight with is 'da bomb.'

<p>In yet another informative post to the MapServer users <a
href="http://lists.umn.edu/archives/mapserver-users.html">mailing list</a>
(login required), Frank Warmerdam explains how to use the tiling and overview
features of <a href="http://gdal.org/">GDAL</a>'s GeoTIFF driver to get
optimal performance on large raster images in MapServer, QGIS, OpenEV, etc.:</p>

<p><blockquote>
Assuming your GeoTIFF input is in.tif, you would do something
like:

<pre>
$ gdalwarp in.tif latlong.tif -t_srs WGS84 -co TILED=YES
$ gdaladdo latlong.tif 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
</pre>

The warp reprojects to lat/long (WGS84) and the output file is
created tiled.  The gdaladdo call adds overviews.  You might want
to skip the level 2 overview if you are wanting to avoid using too
much disk space. Keep in mind that TIFF files cannot be larger
than 4GB.
</blockquote></p>

<p>Tiling the GeoTIFF allows apps to fetch rectangular sub-areas of the raster
more efficiently. Similarly, adding overviews (basically embedded thumbnails)
allows apps to retrieve less data from the file at larger scales, at the
expense of disk space (because all the overviews have to be stored in the
GeoTIFF alongside the original data). Most commercial web mapping apps use one
or both of these techniques to improve server response time. Note that the
reprojection is unnecessary if the GeoTIFF is already in the right projection
for your application.</p>";s:7:"summary";s:1420:"
