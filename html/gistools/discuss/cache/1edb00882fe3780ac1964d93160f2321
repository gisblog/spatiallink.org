There's been a bit of disgruntlement by Scottish viewers of the BBC's new weather map. Many maintain that the new high-tech angling of the map is biased to the southern part of the Island.

One of the competitive advantages of the Microsoft/Pictometry deal for including imagery with the new MSN Virtual Earth map portal is the availability of oblique aerial imagery. These &quot;off nadir&quot; images give the viewer a &quot;jet passenger&quot; view that shows building faces rather than their rooftops, and sometimes can capture ground level facades. Very cool especially if you get vertigo looking at &quot;standard&quot; aerial photographs or satellite imagery.<br /><br />Take for example this shot of some local shops in downtown San Francisco (see below):<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.directionsmag.com/images/companies/pictometry/Pictometry_SanFran.jpg" /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">The building store fronts are clearly in view but the indentities of each proprietor are difficult to reconcile. Still, if you had this image and were unfamiliar with the neighborhood, you can discern the surroundings none the less. Is this an advantage. Well, its better than a stick map. I guess it also leaps tall buildings too, for that matter, to get a good, ground level perspective.<br /></div></div><br />Take also the image below of the Concorde,which was captured while on the tarmac at JRF Airport by Pictometry aircraft. So, if you wanted to know if this was a plane operated by British Airways or Air France, one can clearly see the &quot;Air France&quot; logo on the side of the plane and get a 2.5D perspective of the supersonic transporter.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.directionsmag.com/images/companies/pictometry/Concorde_at_JFK-1.jpg" /><br /></div><br />Here is where the true advantage lies: identity. I can see the logo; I know who owns the plane; or store or building for that matter. If you could see the storefront signs or logos in the first image, that would offer value that I may be even willing to pay for. Supposedly, Pictometry will offer higher resolution to MSN in the future.<br /><br />So, there is the advantage of the oblique view. If I'm looking for the Au Bon Pain to pick up my favorite pastry on the way out of my hotel in an unfamiliar city, and want to know what it looks like when I get to the intersection provided by my MSN MapPoint directory assistance, this view will help to show me  where and in what building that store is located.
