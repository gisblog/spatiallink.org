# Schematics: protection in required directory, encrypted/compressed psswd in inc, ip and file blocks in here, additional block in header.
# Limit Options: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, PATCH, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, and UNLOCK
# Deny From .spam.com: .spam.com works for www.spam.com or virtual.spam.com. And, if you'd like to block access from an entire domain, you can specify just part of an address or domain name. Note that inc files are direct file includes done "inside" the server, rather than being done via HTTP. As such, they should not be affected by .htaccess directives.
# Order Deny,Allow (no space after ,): The Deny directives are evaluated before the Allow directives. Access is allowed by default
# Order Allow,Deny (no space after ,): The Allow directives are evaluated before the Deny directives. Access is denied by default.
# Remember that <Files> directives apply to subdirectories as well, unless specifically overridden which may not be happening here.
# <Directory> can only include directives that are allowed in a directory context, including authentication directives. Note that authentication directives can only be specified in the main httpd.conf file, or in per-directory configuration files (.htaccess files). Directory directives include Options All and AllowOveride None.
