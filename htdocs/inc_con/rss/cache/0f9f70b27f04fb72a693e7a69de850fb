You can physically get your hands on them by <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=downloads.patchesServicePacks.viewPatch&PID=19&MetaID=1198">downloading a service pack</a> and pulling them out of there.  For whatever reason, there is no click through license and no license included in the service packs, so those who live by the letter of the law might feel fine just using them as found.<br /><br />Those of us living by the spirit of the law need to go one level deeper.  We have an ESRI Developer Network package, so I pulled out the SDE developer kit disk and installed the Java clients.  The license I had to agree to in that process did not say anything specific about the client libraries, so I assume they are covered in the general license, which is pretty explicit:<blockquote>Licensee shall not redistribute the Software, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, extensions, components, or DLLs without the prior written approval of ESRI as set forth in an appropriate redistribution license agreement.</blockquote>Looks like black-letter law to me.<br /><br />Like Oracle, ESRI is missing out on an opportunity to grow an ecosystem of dependent open source client applications.  As Howard Butler <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/12/not-so-free-client-libraries.html#comments">points out in a comment</a>, proprietary companies like LizardTech let open source projects ship their SDK clients with their builds.

I answered, citing the pains that <a href="http://www.geotools.org">Geotools</a> (and by extension <a href="http://geoserver.sourceforge.net">Geoserver</a> and <a href="http://udig.refractions.net">uDig</a>) have to go to in supporting Oracle servers while not distributing the actual Oracle JDBC JAR files.  Because we can't include Oracle libraries with our builds, end users have to independently download the JARs and copy them into the right places themselves -- it is not a user-friendly situation at all.<br /><br />"But", Xaviar replied, "they <b>are</b> redistributable."<br /><br />This did not match my understanding of the situation, but he <i>is</i> the expert. So I said I would look into it and get back to him.<br /><br />The source of our mutual misunderstanding turned out to be (surprise!) based on legaleze.  As Xaviar said, the client JDBC JARs <b>are</b> freely redistributable... but there is a catch.  You can only get the JARs in the first place by accepting a license, and the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/htdocs/distlic.html?url=http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/htdocs/jdbc_10201.html">license</a> says that you are allowed to redistribute them only if you do so under the same terms as those given in the original Oracle license.<br /><br />Among the restrictions which any open source project would have to place on its users if they wanted to redistribute the Oracle client libraries are:<blockquote><ul><li>You are not a citizen, national, or resident of, and are not under control of, the government of Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Libya, North Korea, Syria, nor any country to which the United States has prohibited export.<br /><li>You will not download or otherwise export or re-export the Programs, directly or indirectly, to the above mentioned countries nor to citizens, nationals or residents of those countries.<br /><li>You are not listed on the United States Department of Treasury lists of Specially Designated Nationals, Specially Designated Terrorists, and Specially Designated Narcotic Traffickers, nor are you listed on the United States Department of Commerce Table of Denial Orders.<br /><li>You will not download or otherwise export or re-export the Programs, directly or indirectly, to persons on the above mentioned lists.</ul></blockquote>To abide by the  license, not only would we have to to (somehow) ensure that none of the people downloading our builds met the conditions above, but we would also have to get them to promise in turn not to distribute to such people. Forcing the users to copy the JARs by hand starts to look a whole lot better all of a sudden.<br /><br />(Stop. Take a moment to contemplate the lush absurdity of the idea that placing a piece of software behind such a click-through license materially assists the enforcement of export controls in any way. Breath in. Breath out. Ahhhh.)<br /><br />Open source cannot place restrictions on use or redistribution.  It is the ethos.  It is the way things work.  It is not because the restrictions in this case are oddball notions from the national security state.  Any such restrictions are anathema.  My favourite case of this was a piece of Geotools, which had to be re-written when it turned out that a component was licensed under a "public domain except for military use" clause.  Everyone gets to download, use and redistribute open source.

Doing the budgeting and planning just to put together the bid has been very educational.  I has been a good reminder of the value of working with professionals -- the conference center staff and organizer I am working with pulled together the background information and base budget with magical ease.  Everyone has their area of expertise, and it is sure nice to have experts on your side when entering a domain in which you know nothing at all!<br /><br />Then I talked with Mark about pushing PostGIS 1.2.0 out the door, and we did!  Curve support started, some performance hooks I've been wanting for a while, and function signatures to allow easy integration with other SQL/MM database software (this means you, ArcSDE!).  <br /><br />The performance stuff is fun, because I know there will be more -- for every generic spatial predicate (Contains(), for example), there are lots of special cases that don't have to be handled with full computation.  If the bounding boxes of the inputs are disjoint, for example, you know Contains() is false without even starting anything involved.  If both arguments are points -- false!  If one argument is a point and the other is a polygon, you can do a point-in-polygon test instead of a full graph calculation needed for two more complex types. And on and on and on.<br /><br />Finally, I did a "Friday talk" about the history of the <a href='http://www.safe.com'>FME</a>, my favourite non-open source GIS tool.  Friday talks are something we try to do every week at Refractions -- have someone talk about a topic of interest to them that hopefully has some relevance to other folks in the company.  A programming technique, a project summary, a quirk of geography.  Grist for the mill.

Which, to PostGIS people like ourselves suggests the question: "implemented how?"<ul><li>One possibility would be basically a cut'n'paste of their existing SQLServer code, with the SQLServer quirks replaced with PostgreSQL quirks, using SDEBINARY as the spatial type.<br /><li>Another possibility would be to use the PostGIS spatial objects as the underlying storage mechanism, in the same way ArcSDE supports using SDO_GEOMETRY in Oracle.<br /><li>A third possibility would be ESRI implementing their own spatial type in PostgreSQL and then using that.</ul>Sounds strange, doesn't it? Writing a whole new spatial type, when one already exists. Ordinarily I would dismiss the idea -- except that ESRI has <b>already done it for Oracle!</b>.<br /><br />The <a href='http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=A_spatial_type_for_Oracle&anchor=ST_Geom'>ST_GEOMETRY</a> type in ArcSDE 9.1 and up is a native Oracle type (built using the Oracle type-extension mechanism) provided, and recommended, by ESRI for use by ArcSDE.<br /><br />Why would ESRI do this?  <br /><br />The cynical explanation (get this out of the way first) is that it helps break the growing Oracle momentum in tools supporting SDO_GEOMETRY, and confuses the marketplace further about what the "right type" to use is in Oracle for spatial work.  <br /><br />The practical explanation is that ESRI's ST_GEOMETRY for Oracle implements the same semantics and function signatures as the ST_GEOMETRY objects in DB2 and Informix (coincidentally, also implemented in part by ESRI).  This allows ArcSDE to expose a uniform "raw spatial SQL" to clients while still maintaining it's position as the man-in-the-middle of client/server interaction.

Nothing!<br /><br />One of the promises of <a href='http://udig.refractions.net'>uDig</a> is to be an "internet GIS", by which we mean a thick client system capable of consuming and integrating web services in a transparent and low-friction way.  The GIS equivalent of a web browser.  Web browsers use HTTP and HTML and CSS and Javascript to create a rich and compelling client/server interaction, regardless of the client/server pairing.  An internet GIS should use WMS and WFS and SLD to do the same thing, independent of vendor.<br /><br />So, we have been working long and hard on a true WFS client, one that can connect to <b>any</b> WFS and read/write the features therein without modification.  And here's the thing -- it is <b>waaaaaaay</b> harder than it should be.<br /><br />Here is why:<ol><li>First off, generic GML support is hard.  Every WFS exposes its own schema which in turn embeds GML, so a "GML parser" is actually a "generic XML parser that happens to also notice embedded GML", and the client has to be able to turn whatever odd feature collection the server exposes into its internal model to actually render and process it.  However, it is only a hard problem, not an impossible one, and we have solved it.<br /><li>The solution to supporting generic GML is to read the schema advertised by the WFS, and use that to build a parser for the document on the fly.  And this is where things get even harder: lots of servers advertise schemas that differ from the instance documents they actually produce.<ul><br /><li>The difference between schema and instance probably traces back to point #1 above. Because GML and XML schema are "hard", the developers make minor mistakes, and because there have not been generic clients around to heavily test the servers, the mistakes get out into the wild as deployed services.<br /></ul></ol>So, once you have cracked the GML parsing problem (congratulations!) you run headlong into the next problem. Many of the servers have bugs and don't obey the schema/instance contract -- they do not serve up the GML that they say they do.<br /><br />And now, if you aren't just building a university research project, you have a difficult decision. If you want to interoperate with the existing servers, you have to code exceptions around all the previously-deployed bugs.  <br /><br />Unfortunately, our much loved UMN Mapserver is both (a) one of the most widely deployed WFS programs and (b) the one with the most cases of schema/instance mismatch.  Mapserver is not the only law-breaker though, we have found breakages even in proprietary products that passed the CITE tests.<br /><br />All this before you even start editing features!<br /><br />The relative complexity of WFS (compared to, say, WMS) means that the scope of ways implementors can "get it wrong" is much much wider, which in turn radically widens the field of "special cases to handle" that any client must write.<br /><br />In some ways, this situation invokes to good old days of web browsers, when HTML purists argued that when encountering illegal HTML (like an unclosed tag) browsers should stop and spit up an error, while the browser writers themselves just powered through and tried to do a "best rendering" based on whatever crap HTML they happened to be provided with.";s:4:"link";s:60:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/12/can-wfs-really-work.html";s:9:"link_self";s:67:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1664416474186599322";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/1664416474186599322";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:10;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-2734446781416812342";s:9:"published";s:29:"2006-11-16T21:15:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-11-16T22:09:30.578-08:00";s:5:"title";s:10:"Flame Bait";s:12:"atom_content";s:1678:"Why end the evening on a high note, when I can end it rancourously and full of bile!<br /><br />On the <a href='http://postgis.refractions.net/mailman/listinfo/postgis-users'>postgis-users</a> mailing list, Stephen Woodbridge <a href='http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2006-November/013880.html'>writes</a>:<blockquote>Can you describe what dynamic segmentation is?

My particular remit was to do a server capable of handling arbitrary projections and scale sets, which made for an interesting design decision: to extend <a href='http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms'>WMS</a> or not?<br /><br />I mulled it over at the conference, and talked to some of the luminaries like Paul Spencer and <a href='http://think.random-stuff.org/'>Allan Doyle</a>.  My concern was that the amound of alteration required to WMS in order to support the arbitrary projections and scales was such that there was not much benefit remaining in using the WMS standard in the first place -- existing servers wouldn't be able to implement, and existing clients wouldn't be able to benefit.<br /><br />On top of that, a number of the client writers wanted something a little more "tiley" in their specification than WMS.  Rather than requests in coordinate space, they wanted requests in tile space: "give me tile [4,5]!"<br /><br />So, I originally set off to write either a GetTile in WMS or a Tile Server using the <a href='http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards'>Open Web Services</a> baseline from the <a href='http://www.opengeospatial.org'>Open Geospatial Consortium</a>.  <br /><br />But then I had an Intellectual Experience, which came from reading <a href='http://zcologia.com/news/'>Sean Gillies'</a> blog on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer'>REST</a> web services, and <a href='http://zcologia.com/news/283'>his thoughts</a> on how Web Feature Server (WFS) could have been implemented more attractively as a REST interface.  I was drawn in by the Abstract Beauty of the whole concept.<br /><br />So I threw away the half-page of OWS boiler-plate I had started with and began anew, thinking about the tiling problem as a problem of exposing "resources" ala REST.<br /><br />The result is the <a href='http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Tile_Map_Service_Specification'>Tile Map Service</a> specification, and no, it is not really all that RESTful.  That's because tiles themselves are really boring resources, and completely cataloguing a discovery path from root resource to individual tile would add a lot of scruft to the specification that client writers would never use.  So I didn't.<br /><br />That was the general guiding principle I tried to apply during the process -- what information can client writers use.  Rather than writing for an abstract entity, I tried to think of the poor schmuck who would have to write a client for the thing and aim the content at him.<br /><br />I have put up a reference server at <a href='http://mapserver.refractions.net/cgi-bin/tms'>http://mapserver.refractions.net/cgi-bin/tms</a> and there are other servers referenced in the document.

It is all about reprocessing content after all, so here goes...<br /><br /><b>Incentives and Costs</b><br /><br />In response to the "<a href='http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/09/why-sdis-fail.html'>Why SDIs Fail</a>" posting, "randy" <a href='http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/09/why-sdis-fail.html#c115980944292034479'>comments</a>:<blockquote>The key seems to be incentives and the only two I can think of are market incentives and policy mandate incentives. Market incentives are bottom up and way more appealing than top down legal/policy incentives. </blockquote>And I agree.  Incentives are lacking now, except for the "good karma" incentive.  However, low incentives alone are not a barrier to action, it is low incentives <b>in conjunction with</b> a higher cost of action that cause inaction.  The karmic incentive to not litter is relatively low, but the cost of not littering is also very low... hey, there's a garbage can right over there.<br /><br />So we can defeat SDI inaction through <b>two</b> possible routes: increase the incentives to participation, or decrease the costs.  <br /><br />Randy raises a number of possible external incentives, such as legal mandates, to push public organizations into the SDI arena.  In particular for areas where there is a strong argument for mandated participation (public safety) this approach may have legs.  But we know how lower orders of governments love unfunded mandates.<br /><br />I personally think that decreasing the costs has better potential in the short term, by examining the data sharing networks that <b>have</b> succeeded -- the illegal music and movie distribution networks.  Everyone has an incentive to take and no one has an incentive to give, yet the content is out there.  There are technical approaches to enhancing sharing in sharing-averse communities which can be scavenged from this arena and brought into ours.<br /><br /><b>Even Better Technology</b><br /><br /><a href='http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/09/why-sdis-fail.html#c115983453872155353'>Rob Atkinson</a> looks into the future and sees that the tools we have now are not equipped for doing effective data sharing.<blockquote>What we need is the mechanism by which SDIs can grow (from top-down and bottom-up) to bridge that gap. Much like DNS provides domain roots and the bind protocol. What we need to do to realise SDI benefits is, as you say, enable massively scalable access to data updates by making life significantly easier at the grass roots level, but also by introducing a level of coherence to enable investment decisions at the national level.</blockquote>I agree that many "real" data sharing applications are going to need some super-amazing technology to bind together content.  Ontology and deep metadata.  But in the meantime, looser, more human-mediated approaches are required to bridge the gap.  <br /><br />As Rob says, life needs to be easier for the grass roots.  That is job one.  Once the data is flowing, the coneheads in the central agencies can figure out techno-magic to stitch it all together, but until the data starts flowing the whole discussion is just so much intellectual masturbation.<br /><br /><b>I Propose...</b><br /><br />That job one is to get the data flowing.  There needs to be a single, user-facing application, a GeoNapster, that makes sharing data and finding data ludicrously simple.  So simple that there is no excuse not to do it except sheer bullheadedness.  Get the data flowing and then worry about how to integrate it.<br /><br />Recognize that data at the lowest levels of government is created by one or two people.  Pitch the tool and approach to that level.  Make it search and find just as well as it shares.  Integrate it with the desktop, even with the major vendor software, if that makes it work more easily.<br /><br />The data sets that are "corporately" managed by state and federal bureaucracies may have to wait, or be brought online in the mode of <a href='http://www.nconemap.net/'>NCOneMap</a>, with careful one-on-one cajolling.  But the SDI builders have to <b>know what they want</b>, what is of value, and be strategic, not shot-gun, in gathering those contributors.<br /><br />Being strategic means making hard decisions about what will be used, and what is useful, given the current technology available.  Imagery is widely useful with the current technology.  Complex inventory data usually is not (would you like to see the forests by stand age? species? do the different jurisdictions use the same inventory techniques? are these apples or oranges or both?) so do not waste money or time on it.  <br /><br />Get out to the operational GIS level, meet the people who are going to use these services (in theory) and feed in new information (in theory) and figure out how to get involved in their day to day work.  How can an SDI become as ingrained in the daily workflow of GIS technologies as Google is in our techno-lives?<br /><br />Put the strategic diagrams, the boxes and arrows, in a drawer for a while.

I meant "next month".<br /><br /><b>Making Technology Work</b><br /><br />Good news about the larger SDI vision is hard to come by.  The larger vision includes a central catalogue, clients that search the catalogue, find services, and then consume the services.  Portions of the vision are still "in progress" from a technological point of view -- standardized searching of catalogues for services is still a topic of discussion, not a fully settled issue, so it will be a while before the problem can be delegated to the political realm of getting folks on board.<br /><br />The good news is that the various <b>parts</b> of the vision are coming together.<ul><li>The WMS specification is fully proven, and now widely implemented.  Most importantly, it is implemented in proprietary desktop tools with wide user bases.  When you think about the product development and release cycles involved, getting a new standard into a product is a pretty complex dance.<li>The WFS specification is on "phase one" of widespread adoption -- a number of vendors have implemented half-assed attempts at WFS clients.  The next round of attempts will probably be much better and useful, which will in turn charge up the relevance of the technology.</ul>Note that I am talking about <b>client</b> implementations primarily when talking about the maturity of the standards.  This is because the clients have always lagged behind the servers, perhaps because providing a good user experience of a complex technology is difficult.  For example, imagine how much traction the HTTP/HTML server standard would have without a good HTTP/HTML client application (like the one you're using to read this page).  <br /><br />(As an aside, keep the HTTP/HTML example in mind the next time someone says "The standard has been around for 3 years, and you can buy a server that supports it from 4 different vendors".  The answer is "Yeah, but are there any clients for the server that do not suck rocks? Toy web implementations from the server vendors don't count.")<br /><br />So, back to good news: key client/server standards are moving from the "conceptual" stage to the "works for me" stage.  Also, people are getting better at setting up the servers to not be disastrously slow -- and as they garner more users, they will get more complaints when they do a bad job, which will self-reinforce the whole system to higher quality.  (The NASA WMS administrators may hate what the Worldwind client has done in terms of creating load, but I am sure they would admit that the experience of figuring out how to solve the problem has made their services better.)<br /><br /><b>Getting Data Online</b><br /><br />There are some good examples of organizations getting data online, and some bad examples.  The bad ones usually consist of central organizations saying "For the love of Pete, put some data online! If you put data online, I'll give you a cookie!"<br /><br />The good ones are more directed, recognize the operational/analytical divide, and work to bridge that divide with face-to-face communication and assistance.<br /><br />My favorite example is an SDI effort out of North Carolina, <a href='http://www.nconemap.net'>NCOneMap</a>.  With very little funding from the state government, NCOneMap is stitching together an SDI built on data served up from the county level.  By all rights, this should be a colossal failure (herding poorly resourced, highly operational-minded counties into an SDI), but they are making it work, by:<ul><li><b>Being focussed on what they really need.</b>  Yeah, it would be nice to get absolutely everything the county as online, to just say "put it all online", but what the state really needs is what they don't have, primarily a regularly updated street map, and a regularly updated parcel map.  So that is what they focus on.  Just getting each county to publish those two layers via WMS.<li><b>Being helpful making it happen.</b> NCOneMap does not have a big budget, but they do have a few dedicated staff.  The staff has written very detailed directions about configuring ArcIMS as a WMS server.  They give workshops on setting up WMS and writing FGDC standard metadata.  They go to the counties and help them one-on-one.  In general, they recognize that a low-priority activity like publishing data online is going to require some lubrication to get moving, and are willing to apply it.<li><b>Establishing exactly what they want.</b> They want a WMS with a couple layers, with certain metadata filled in a certain way, and they will train you in exactly how to make it, and even help you make it if you can't.  The bar is just about as low as it can go.</ul>(I have often thought that the best way to get the bar on the floor would be to actually <b>give</b> a WMS server to each organization you want to publish data, with a filesystem share available through one network interface and another network interface for the internet connections, and have people just copy their files into a directory tree on the server.  The server could automatically read the tree and convert it into a WMS/WFS server, and push that information up to the central SDI registry.  Given the cost of hardware today and the availability of open source, open standard software, such an idea is inherently achievable.)<br /><br /><b>Creating an Example</b><br /><br />One of the upsides of the technological maturity of the WMS standard (and upcoming maturity of the WFS standard) is that it is possible for SDI seed organizations to "set a good example" by publishing their large data holdings.  Nothing hammers home the virtuous benefits of sharing more than sharing yourself, as St Francis of Assisi demonstrated.  <br /><br />One of the great instances of this concept is the "<a href='http://www.geobase.ca'>GeoBase</a>" portion of the Canadian "<a href='http://www.geoconnections.org'>GeoConnections</a>" program.  Unlike most national SDI programs, GeoConnections has actually has some non-trivial funding attached to it, and some of that money is put towards to creation of the GeoBase layers.  One of the earliest big layers to be made available is a complete <a href='http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/'>Landsat</a> coverage of Canada, compiled from 2000-2005 and published via WMS. <br /><br />By putting their money where their mouth is, national SDI promoters can simultaneously prove their commitment to the concept while demonstrating the effectiveness of web services.  Note that it is important that the service provided be a very good example: the first time I tried to GeoBase Landsat WMS service it was very, very slow, and that initial impression has been lingering ever since.<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><br />We're doomed! Doomed!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news all adheres to various components of the SDI fabric, but the fabric itself continues to be torn apart by the lack of incentives to "good behavior" on the part of potential SDI participants.<ul><li>The NCOneMap experience shows that careful nurturing and love can bring out better behavior from potential SDI participants, but even then 100% participation is not guaranteed.  And maps with holes in them really suck.<li>The technological basis of SDI is continuing to mature, and some of it is particularly workable, but there is still some immaturity in core components of the fabric (like catalogues).<li>National agencies are trying to create good examples, by seeding the field with their own data, but so far the spirit of sharing has not been seeping much lower down the jurisdictional food chain.</ul>It seems to me that failure is not guaranteed, but the equation of SDI participation still needs some fine tuning.  Given that people have a low incentive to participate ("it makes me a better person"), what is required is a dramatic lowering of the bar to participation ("it takes longer to blow my nose than to participate in the SDI").<br /><br />For a parallel, look at the world of P2P music sharing.  I have no incentive to share my music, I only really want to consume <b>other people's</b> music.  But when I pull music from others, the music sharing software automatically shares everything I pull down.  Also, sharing my music is as easy as dragging files and dropping them into the application window.  A GeoNapster could dramatically improve data sharing, by making the process very very very easy.<br /><br /><i>(Anyone want to hire us to build GeoNapster?

It lays out all the various national and sub-national SDI initiatives, and their strategies, and it all seems like very reasonable stuff.<br /><br />Except that none of them are succeeding.  <br /><br />Some of them have been at it for over 10 years (like the <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/nsdi/nsdi.html">NSDI</a> work in the United States).  Some of them have even been backed by some reasonable funding (like the <a href="http://www.geoconnections.org">CGDI</a> in Canada).  None of them really have public penetration.

It doesn't feel like it.  Even within the cognoscenti of GIS professionals the SDI initiatives have less intellectual traction than the consumer portals.<br /><br />So perhaps this is failure.  Why?<br /><br /><b>The Missing Incentive</b><br /><br />SDIs make the virtuous and correct assertion that if everyone shared their data, nearest to the point of creation, using various technical tricks and standards, then distribution and integration cost for everyone would go down. We would all be winners.<br /><br />It is a classic case of global accounting.  Sum up everyone's bottom line, and behold: in aggregate everyone is better off!  <br /><br />But not everyone is equally better off.<br /><br />The operational folks, the guys actually building parcel fabrics and tenuring layers and physical infrastructure databases, are not doing it for fun, and they aren't doing it to share.  They are doing it to meet particular operational goals that are specific to themselves and themselves only.  <br /><br />Publishing their data to the rest of the world is a pure cost center for them.  It is a small cost center, publishing the data is not hard, but it is still a cost. Publishing provides them no substantial business benefit.  It provides <b>other people</b> with a huge benefit, hence the positive global bottom line, but for the <b>most important people to the process</b>, the data creators, it is just a pain in the ass.<br /><br />I call this problem the "operational/analytical divide", because it happens everywhere, from accounting registers to airline reservation systems.  The needs of the people operationally working with the data do not align with the needs of the people driving up analysis to decision makers.  Hence a million data marts bloom, and various other strategies to give the analysts the data they need without impeding the operational folks.<br /><br />Note that the folks pushing SDI are almost exclusively coming from the analytical, decision support side of the equation.  This is a recipe for frustration, particularly when trying to build something as loosely coupled as an SDI.  So most SDI implementations still lack access to some of the most informative, up-to-date information, the operational information maintained and updated regularly by land managers.<br /><br />This is not a recipe for relevance.<br /><br /><b>It Gets Worse</b><br /><br />Often the local solution to the problem of operational disinterest is for the analytical side to take on the whole cost of integration and provide a single analytical environment for their jurisdiction.<br /><br />Aha! Solution! These enlightened analysts will then take their integrated data and publish <b>it</b> out to the SDI and thus the world.  Except the analysts suffer the same disease as the operational folks, just with larger borders.<br /><br />In British Columbia, the analytical response to data integration problems was to build, over several years, a <a href="http://lrdw.ca">data warehouse</a> which holds all the operational and inventory data, updated in real time.  Cool stuff, and quite useful to them! But is this data available to the national SDI?  Only a handful of layers.<br /><br />Why? For the British Columbia analytical folks, providing data to the national SDI has little or no return-on-investment. So while they will acknowledge that it is a nice idea (it <b>is</b> a nice idea!), they will also acknowledge that it is not a high priority.  What's in it for them?<br /><br /><b>Users? What users?</b><br /><br />On the technical side, even where data is available, the user experience has not been well served.  The implementation of SDI technology thus far still seems "proof of concept", getting as far as "does this idea work?", but not as far as "can we make this work well?"<br /><br />So, even where large quantities of data are published online (in the case of, for example the <a href="http://www.geobase.ca/geobase/en/data/ldsat7.html">GeoBase LandSat</a> data made available by the Canadian CGDI effort), the access is sufficiently slow to deter all but the most avid users.  Specifications for response time (where they exist, and they often do not) are absurdly slow (perhaps they were written in the mid-1990s).  Less than 5 seconds to return a map might be OK if I only want one map, but any interactive application will require me to request numerous maps in the course of exploring the data, and those 5 seconds really pile up.<br /><br />Why was Google Maps a sensation, while Mapquest remained a yawn?  Google optimized the part of the process most annoying to users, the interactive exploration part.  Why did Google do this and not SDIs?  One can only assume it was because building the system is the goal of SDI efforts (and not to be diminished, the system is very hard!) not thinking about the end user.<br /><br />But (I can hear them yelling) the consumer space is not what SDIs are about! Then who are they about, because I cannot think of a market segment well served by SDI efforts to date.  Not GIS professionals, they cannot abide the forest of web-mapping obstacles that have been erected in front of various data bases over the years.  Not general public consumers, as noted above.  Not decision makers, they can't use the tools provided, and the professionals who serve them are still doing the same song-and-dance-and-secret-handshake number they were doing 10 years ago to achieve data access.<br /><br />Attending a talk this year about the emergency response in British Columbia to bird flu, I was struck that despite all the state-of-the-art technology being used (ArcMap, SDE, LANs and wireless) the fundamental business architecture (madly collect big pile of data, madly print maps) is no different than if the talk were given 10 years ago.  No SDI in sight, despite the near-constant pitch of SDI as a cure-all for integration in critical response settings.<br /><br /><b>Oh, And the Unpleasant Matter of the Bill</b><br /><br />Of course, no discussion of the impotence of SDI efforts could fail to acknowledge the pivotal role of data cost recovery policies in blunting the sharing of information between organizations and levels of government.<br /><br />The most valuable information for sharing and decision making is the most volatile, because direct close-to-source access assures timeliness and accuracy.  But volatile data is also perceived (correctly) as having the most intrinsic value.  And so the creators hold it close, and only share it in traditional ways (file shipping, protected download) using traditional business models (pay to play).<br /><br /><b>Did I Mention Metadata</b><br /><br />And you thought you could get out without being subjected to yet another discussion of metadata.<br /><br />Metadata is the core of the SDI vision, since a distributed system of resoures requires a searchable registry of available resources in order to direct people to the information they need.<br /><br />But, like basic sharing itself, metadata creation suffers from missing incentives, because metadata is all about <b>other</b> people (not important people, like <b>me</b>).  I don't need to write metadata about my data, <b>I already know all about my data!</b>.  There are no awards for good meta-data writing, except karmic ones, and karma doesn't pay the bills.  <br /><br />This may sound overly harsh, but a quick review of the contents of the public capabilities files of <a href='http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=inurl%3Arequest%3Dgetcapabilities'>web services currently online</a> should dispell most people's notions of metadata quality.<br /><br /><b>Loosely Coupled Things Are Easy To Break</b><br /><br />One of the ironies of the SDI-for-crisis-response sales pitch is that it holds up the classic centralized solution as having a "single point of failure" (boo! shame!).  Unspoken is the fact that the SDI solution has N points of failure, where N is the number of nodes.<br /><br />Our company had the fortune to have the opportunity to build a <a href="http://aardvark.gov.bc.ca/apps/coin/">client portal</a> that used SDI resources to provide an integrated viewing and data searching capability.  It was "SDI come to life", and a great learning experience.  Though our code worked fine, our delivery was a nightmare.<ul><li>The map application was too slow.  Well, that wasn't our code's fault, one of the servers we referenced for base mapping was really slow. Eventually we found a faster one.<li>The search service(s) returned really terse results.  Well, that was what the metadata server returned, we had no control over that.  (Actually we did, we could obtain more verbose results but then the search took several minutes to return. Pick your poison.)<li>The search service was really slow.  Again, ask a slow server a question, get a slow answer.<li>And finally the <i>coup de gr&#226;ce</i>.  After delivery, the application kept breaking.  Or rather, the services it depended on kept breaking.  Or changing their API just a little.  But since we were the client-facing part of the whole system, it was us who got the service calls.</ul>Reliability is not something any part of the SDI infrastructure takes overall responsibility for, so any component can drag down any of the others.  In the end, it all gets delegated to the last link in the loosely coupled chain, the client software.  But the architecture is supposed to make getting data easy, and instead it makes it really hard, because the client has to keep track of all the servers and their reliability.  <br /><br />Some SDI server providers make an effort to provide really high uptimes and great performance, but it only takes <b>one</b> crappy server to make the user experience terrible.  So the whole system reliability problem gets delegated to the client.  That makes for a lot of work on systems which are supposed to be relatively lightweight.<br /><br /><b>We're Doomed! Doomed!</b><br /><br />So, to sum up:<ul><li>Data creators have no incentive to join SDIs;<li>Data analyzers have incentive, but once they have all the data <b>they</b> need, they're done;<li>The user experience is pretty uniformly worse than what commercial outfits  provide;<li>Data pricing policies are locking up much of the "good" data, even if people were interested in sharing;<li>Even the people who <b>are</b> sharing aren't doing a very good job of it, since their metadata is garbage; and,<li>When put into operation, the whole system is unbelievably brittle, leading to yet more bad user experiences.</ul>Is there no good news at all?

I don't! (Not much. Well. Not all the time.)<br /><br />I start with something that sounds controversial, but really is just observationally factual: "users do not contribute anything to open source projects".  It sounds like I am putting them down ("darned users!") but that is not what I am doing. It is just straightforward observation that if you aren't adding code, documentation, bug reports, or user support to a project, if you are just downloading and using the software, you are not adding any value to the project.  From the project point of view, you might as well not exist.  If it weren't for the entry in the server log, they couldn't prove your existence.<br /><br />I hope that the above is not actually controversial.<br /><br />Which brings us to a different idea, "user focused", why should I bother catering to people who are effectively invisible to the activities of the project?  There is nice <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/08/open-source-gis-on-every-desktop.html#c115680712775624804">comment </a> from "step" which includes this:<blockquote>There are a lot of contributors to Firefox (myself included) who never would have become so had they not first been a user.</blockquote>So, there is a valid "developer focused" reason to be "user focused".  Using is a gateway drug for developers.  I find that very persuasive indeed.  Hopefully non-controversial as well.<br /><br />All this gets bound up and confuzzulated with my "firehose of money" comment in my <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/08/open-source-gis-on-every-desktop.html">last posting</a>.  That comment <b><i>is</i></b> controversial, and seems to be the core item riling folks up.<br /><br />My belief (and I am sure there are plenty of counterexamples to prove me wrong, but then, I am not trying to postulate a law of nature here) is that large, complex, user-facing applications (like, say, office suites or web browsers or <a href="http://udig.refractions.net">GIS desktops</a>) are sufficiently weighty that incubating them, getting them from a "concept" level of quality to a "user focused" level of quality, requires a large initial financial commitment.  Or a large initial amount of time (Ooop, you caught me! I'm hedging! Creating some wriggle room!).  A firehouse of money, or a patient drip drip drip of a rivulet of time.<br /><br />Asa Dotzler thinks that, with respect to the Firefox project (and unspecified others), <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2006/08/for_the_new_and.html">I am full of it</a>.  I think that, in ignoring the six years of corporate funding (the proverbial "firehose") for technology that underlies Firefox, he is gilding the lily.       Firefox is great work, but attributing its success to the community effort alone is as unfair as attributing it to corporate money alone.  Ooops, I did that.

He took a look at <a href='http://udig.refractions.net'>uDig</a> (thanks!) but, unsurprisingly, finds that it ain't <a href='http://www.esri.com/arcgis'>ArcGIS</a> quite yet.  His prescription is not for the faint of heart.<blockquote>If you want people to switch you need to make the transition as painless as possible. Firefox got people to switch to IE by<ol><li>Making better software<br /><li>Not making user learn a new UI for interacting with the web<br /><li>importing all their IE favorites<br /><li>THEN building in cool new features that keep people around</ol></blockquote>So, all we have to do is make something better than ArcGIS, but not so much better that it is not familiar to the existing user base, that works transparently with all their existing data and presumably their .mxd files too.  And give it away for free.  <br /><br />"Just be like <a href='http://www.mozilla.org'>Firefox</a>."  There are a couple of problems with this idea. <ul><li>The first problem is the idea that garnering users is "the goal". It is not. The misunderstanding is reasonable, because for proprietary companies it <b>is</b> the goal -- more users implies more licensing dollars. For open source projects, more users just means somewhat more download bandwidth and slightly higher number of beginner questions on the mailing lists. What open source projects want to attract is not users -- it is developers.  Developers will make the project stronger, add features, fix bugs, do all the things that end users want, but cannot do for themselves.<br /><li>The second problem is that Firefox is not a normal open source project.  The <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/'>Mozilla Foundation</a> has a lot of employees, most of them working on development, and <a href='http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39189475,00.htm'>a deal</a> with <a href='http://www.google.com'>Google</a> that nets them <a href='http://www.scroogle.org/mozilla.html'>millions of dollars</a> each year.  They can afford to be end user focused, because they have a paid pool of developers already in house.</ul>It seems like all of the "user" success stories in the open source world (Firefox, <a href='http://www.openoffice.org'>Open Office</a>, some of the "<a href='http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/'>desktop Linux</a>" efforts) have at their core one common feature -- a large and ongoing firehose of money.  Absent the firehose, it is hard to aggregate enough continuous effort to create desktop applications that include both the number of features and quality of finish necessary to entice the otherwise unmotivated "user".<br /><br />uDig has enough features and stability to be useful right now to a narrow pool of developers creating custom applications with specific toolsets.  Hopefully in the future it will have more features and stability, and the pool will be less narrow.  But I predict it will still be dominated by developers.  <br /><br />And that's fine with me.   <br /><br />If Steven adopted uDig and <a href='http://postgis.refractions.net'>PostGIS</a> for his shop, it would not do a thing for my bottom line.  But if he built an application around it, he would either add a little functionality (which would help me with my clients) or maybe hire us to add a little functionality (which would help the bottom line directly).<br /><br />Open source is not about users, it is about developers. It is only about users in so far as users become sufficiently engaged in the project that they either become developers themselves, or support developers through careful bug finding or documentation.<br /><br />The correct models are not Firefox or Open Office (unless someone wants to point a money firehose at me... I won't object) those projects are aberations.  The correct models are <a href='http://www.linux.org'>Linux</a>, <a href='http://www.apache.org'>Apache</a>, <a href='http://www.perl.org'>Perl</a>, <a href='http://www.postgresql.org'>PostgreSQL</a> -- not user-friendly, but still <b>very useful</b>.";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/08/open-source-gis-on-every-desktop.html";s:9:"link_self";s:66:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/115635432940202844";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/115635432940202844";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:17;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:58:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-115594551491722327";s:9:"published";s:29:"2006-08-18T15:28:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-10-21T11:22:57.944-07:00";s:5:"title";s:32:"Case Studies Considered Harmful?";s:12:"atom_content";s:1130:"Over the past month, I have been trying to compile a list of good <br /><a href='http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/casestudies/'>case studies</a> of organizations using PostGIS in their daily business.

ESRI may, or may not, support using PostGIS native spatial geometries as the geometry type in ArcSDE.

From there, some other folks passed it on, and finally the cycle closed again, as I found a <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2006/07/28/state-of-net-open-source-gis/">posting-about-a-posting</a> on James Fee's excellent blog.<br /><br />The paper itself is a backgrounder for a talk I have been trying with varying degrees of success to shoehorn into 30-minute time slots for the past several years.  Any student of the open source GIS world will soon realize that in order to try and talk about it coherently, a great deal will have to be left out.  That said, my criteria for taking and leaving have hardly been scientific.  <br /><ul><li>I have tried to include projects that are "important" for infrastructural reasons (like the widely re-used libraries).<br /><li>I have tried to include projects that are "big" in terms of having more than a few developers or users.<br /><li>I have included projects that meet neither of the above criteria, but I just personally find "neat" or "promising"<br /><ul><li>"Neat" like GMT, which has a small development community,and no technical ties to the rest of its tribe, but is really useful for UNIX types stringing calculations together, a great power-user tool for non-developers.<br /><li>"Promising" like Mapnik, with a very focussed developer with some very clear design goals up front, and a shameless love of the bleeding edge.</ul></ul>James guesses that my choices have something to do with focussing on "the open source GIS clique that revolves around Refractions and OSGeo", which is not correct.  I include references to projects (QGIS, gvSIG, GMT, TerraLib, OpenEV, OpenMap, Mapbender) which our company has never touched, or which have no association with OSGeo.  Like everyone, I write through the frame of my experience, but I do try to get beyond it occasionally.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.sharpgis.net/OpenSourceGISCanOnlyBeMadeUsingEitherCAndJava.aspx">original post</a> took issue either with my failure to include a ".Net tribe", or perhaps with the whole "tribe" concept entirely.  <br /><br />I won't defend the lack of a ".Net tribe" section. The document was largely written about three years ago, and updated more or less incrementally since then. When I did the initial survey, there was no .Net GIS community that minimally met the standards I was holding the other tribes to.  That has changed now.  Attendees at my talks this year will have heard me point out that gap in my materials.<br /><br />I do defend the "tribe" concept, as a way of organizing a talk about open source GIS, because I believe that the "community" is more important than the technology.  Do a little association graph of high profile members of the communities and you will find they all clump around particular groups of projects, and those groups tend to be defined by their implementation language.<br /><br />The same seems to be true of the .Net tribe. As I read the contributor names to those projects, I find few points of reference to contributors in the other tribes, with the exception of a spome people who have gotten involved in the Java side just enough to port things to .Net.<br /><br />Anyhow, if people are going to read my work and take it seriously, I have a responsibility to update it a little more carefully and frequently.  Among the things I noted while doing talks this spring:<br /><ul><li>I do not have an entry for Worldwind! Oops!<br /><li>OpenEV pretty irrelevant these days, the world has passsed it by. So it is due to be cut.<br /><li>Same thing for WKB4J, all its functionality seems to have migrated to other places.<br /><li>GeoAPI should probably be cut from the talk. Though it is a dependent library for GeoTools, its purpose is just too abstract to clearly explain.<br /><li>The "web" projects are hard to talk about definitively, because there are so many and it is still so unclear where the balance of implementation is settling.

I was very proud, because at the time it was the only example of a decent desktop interface with a proper web services hook.<br /><br />The times, the are a-catching-up to me! About the same time we were cobbling together our first catalogue of OGC WMS and WFS services, Jeremy Bartley at the University of Kansas was doing a similar thing, except he was mining Google for ArcIMS services.  (It should come as some disappointment to boosters of the OGC that he found about 10 times as many ArcIMS servers as we found OGC WMS servers of all types (including ArcIMS).)<br /><br />Bartley took the results of his mining, and like us, stuffed them into a database for searching in useful ways: by layer and keyword.  He exposed the result as <a href="http://www.mapdex.org">Mapdex</a>.  For a while, Mapdex was just an HTML web user interface, which made it an interesting novelty, but not exactly an integrated experience.  <br /><br />Then Bartley added a (again, simple!) web services API to the Mapdex database.  Now the doors were wide open, and along came the final piece: an <a href="http://www.mapdex.org/MapdexToolbar/">ArcMap toolbar</a> that allows direct searching of Mapdex and adding of services to the ArcMap application in real time.  So now uDig is not longer unique in providing this particular capability.<br /><br />I hope this stuff is not being lost on the OGC: facts on the ground are being established, and things that work now will be adopted in favour of things that do not.  Complex standards have utility, but if you want them to be adopted you need to provide a real reference implementation that people can deploy easily, without necessarily understanding the standard itself.  I would suggest BSD- or MIT- licensed open source code for things like GML parsing, Catalogue client, WFS client, WMS client, OpenLS client, and so on.  <br /><br />The existence of freely-usable reference client code would allow people to quickly enrich their particular client applications with OGC web services ability, making the protocols more relevant and allowing the server makers (who form the bulk of the standards writing pool) to sell more of their product.<br /><br />Ding! Ding! Ding! Time to wake up, the future is here, and it is not using OGC standards!";s:4:"link";s:76:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/02/more-simple-web-services-catalogues.html";s:9:"link_self";s:66:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/113961315735042629";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/113961315735042629";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:21;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:58:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-113920241067914029";s:9:"published";s:29:"2006-02-05T20:32:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-10-21T11:22:57.722-07:00";s:5:"title";s:43:"Open Source Geospatial Foundation @ Chicago";s:12:"atom_content";s:4400:"I got home from Chicago this afternoon, and though I am a little loopy from travel, I had better write something down before the moment is gone.<br /><br />It was a very interesting experience to have all these open source people in the same room at the same time.  While I had met all of them (with the exception of a couple of Autodesk folks) at different times and places, this was the first time that particular combination of people were all in the same place at one.  <br /><br />The discussion was good, and surprisingly on point the whole time, which is great for a group of 25 opinionated people.  Gary Lang of Autodesk did an excellent job ensuring that all the important topics were covered, while letting the discussion move at more-or-less its own pace.  The IRC channel was a great forum for carrying on parallel discussions to the verbal points being made.  Rather than interrupting a speaker, folks could jot a point into IRC, and if it was trenchant enough it would come up verbally shortly anyways.  An interesting example of a meld of old and new forms of discourse.<br /><br />The summaries at <a href="http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=2092">Directions Magazine</a> and <a href="http://mappinghacks.com/index.cgi/2006/02/04#osgeo-foundation">Mapping Hacks</a> cover the details of decisions quite well, so I won't go over that ground again.<br /><br />One thing that the recaps do not cover is that I was under some pressure on a couple of occasions to bring <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net">PostGIS</a> (and to a lesser degree <a href="http://udig.refractions.net">uDig</a>) to the Foundation right away.  I recognize that PostGIS is considered a core piece of the open source GIS product stack right now, and that is what is generating the pressure -- the desire to have all the "big guns" under the Foundation roof right away.  But we have spent a lot of effort to get PostGIS to where it is, and I am not inclined to jump into the Foundation without giving a good deal of thought about the benefits and risks.<br /><br />As I <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2005/10/open-source-company-oxymoron.html">talked about</a> a couple months ago, our open source work is a company calling card with respect to our abilities: our abilities with the products we make; and our abilities in general.  Our projects let potential clients understand the quality of our work and and our enthusiasm, even if they have never met us or even heard of us before: the projects are tangible proof that we are a good company.  If we move our projects into the Foundation, the direct link between the projects and ourselves gets severed.  Now they are Foundation projects, not Refractions projects, and the "halo" effect is somewhat diminished.  Sure, smart folks who read the email lists or the commit logs will figure out that we are doing the work, but that is a long ways from the current fairly obvious linkages between the projects and the company.<br /><br />The flip side is that taking the projects away from the (one, smallish) company and into the Foundation (with Big Important Companies as funders and backers) adds a new halo of legitimacy to the projects themselves.  And therein lies the calculation.  Does making the projects look better help us enough to offset the loss of direct project/company linkage?<br /><br />I do not know.<br /><br />One of the things I will be doing is talking to people who have some distance from the whole issue, and see how they perceive both ourselves, our projects, and the foundation.  I certainly do not have enough distance from the issues to have an undistorted view of the issue, and neither do the people in Chicago who wanted us to join right away.  So it will take some time and some thought.<br /><br />Strangely, it seemed that we were the only organization with this particular quandry.  Autodesk actually <span style="font-style:italic;">wants</span> to break the linkage between their open source project and their company.  Most of the other projects are classic multi-individual projects that came into being without corporate gestation.  One exception is ka-map, which was gestated by DM Solutions, and will eventually put them into the same should we/shouldn't we cycle as I am in now.  But ka-map is still a new project, so people were not pressuring them to jump into the pool right out of the gate.";s:4:"link";s:74:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/02/open-source-geospatial-foundation.html";s:9:"link_self";s:66:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/113920241067914029";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/113920241067914029";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:22;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:58:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-113468724154882226";s:9:"published";s:29:"2005-12-15T14:34:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-10-21T11:22:57.667-07:00";s:5:"title";s:25:"The United States of ESRI";s:12:"atom_content";s:1446:"James Fee's <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2005/12/14/yea-im-looking-at-mapserver-enterprise/">latest posting</a> about his experiences with <a href="http://www.esri.com/">ESRI</a> technical support has unleashed a torrent of responses, most of which agree that the ESRI developer experience has gone downhill over the last few years, but some of which are downright surreal in their defence of the GIS giant:<br /><blockquote>ESRI should pull your blog off of the EDN page.

The hypothesis was: an open source community would contribute financially to a shared goal, to directly fund development, with multiple members each contributing a little to create a large total contribution. Note that this is different from a single community member funding a development they need (and others might also need but not pay for). This is a number of entities pitching in simultaneously, and really is the preferred way (I think) to share the pain and share the gain.<br /><br />The story started with a post from Oleg Bartunov on the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgresSQL</a> hackers list:<br /><blockquote>I want to inform that we began to work on concurrency and recovery support in GiST on our's own account and hope to be ready before 8.1 code freeze. There was some noise about possible sponsoring of our work, but we didn't get any offering yet, so we're looking for sponsorship! <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2005-06/msg00294.php">[Full email...]</a></blockquote>The original noise about sponsorship had actually come from me, about 18 months earlier, when it became clear that the full table locks in the existing <a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/%7Emegera/postgres/gist/">GiST index code</a> were going to be a future bottleneck. So, I felt obligated to follow up! Here was a chance to see open source "values" in action: everyone would benefit from this improvement, so surely when given the opportunity to help fund it and ensure it came to fruition, contributors would leap to the fore. I wrote to <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/">postgis-users</a>:<br /><blockquote>Oleg and Teodor are ready to attack GiST concurrency, so the time has come for all enterprise PostGIS users to dig deep and help fund this project ... Refractions Research will contribute $2000 towards this development project, and will serve as a central bundling area for all funds contributed towards this project. As such, we will provide invoices that can be provided to accounts payable departments and cash cheques on North American banks to get the money oversees to Oleg and Teodor. No, we will not assess any commissions for this: we want to see this done. <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2005-June/008294.html">[Full email...]</a></blockquote>The response was... Underwhelming. There is nothing like a sense of urgency to provoke motion. The problem is analogous to standing in front of a mass of people with an unpleasant task and yelling "any volunteers?" Everyone waits for someone to step else forward. As the silence stretches out, the pressure builds and eventually volunteers step forward. On an email list, though, no one can hear the silence! My second email was an attempt to make the silence palpable:<br /><blockquote>Just an update. There are 700 people on this mailing list currently. As of this morning, I have received zero (0) responses on this. <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2005-June/008316.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">[Full email...]</span><br /></a></blockquote>At this point the dam finally broke and multiple companies came forward to contribute. Some contributors were companies that use PostGIS in their operations and could actually anticipate the future need for improved concurrency. This was classic enlightened self-interest, and my only disappointment was that such a relatively small cross-section of the PostGIS user community was capable or interested in seeing the long term benefit of the short term investment.<br /><br />Other contributors signed on purely because it was the "right thing to do". This was also a form of enlightened self-interest, but one with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">much</span> broader view of future personal benefit.  The best example of this was <a href="http://www.cadcorp.com/">Cadcorp</a>, a spatial software company from the UK. Cadcorp makes proprietary GIS software. Cadcorp does not even use PostGIS themselves (except for testing). But, their clients do use PostGIS, and their product can act as a PostGIS data viewer and editor. Cadcorp invested in improving PostgreSQL, because it would improve PostGIS, which would improve their clients experience of using their software with PostGIS, which would (in the long view) enhance the value of their software. Now <span style="font-weight: bold;">that</span> is seeing the big picture.<br /><br />The final totals were both quite good (about $8000 total contributions, with no individual contribution exceeding $2000) and not so good (only 9 contributing companies given 700+ members on the postgis-users mailing list).<br /><br />The final technical results were great! Index recovery from system crashes now works transparently, and performance under concurrence read/write does not scale into a brick wall anymore.<br /><br />I am pleased that this work got done, but I think the experience has taught me a few things about drumming shared contributions out of the community:<br /><ul>   <li>A sense of urgency is required. The work had to be done before the PostgreSQL 8.1 release, or a whole release cycle would go by before we had an opportunity to get this into PostgreSQL again.</li>   <li>A visible target would help. Having a "United Way thermometer" would probably have been a good thing. Having a fixed funding target would also help.</li>   <li>A well-written prospectus helps. I did not have one to start, but did one up and it was used by a number of technical community members to get approval from their non-technical managers.</li>   <li>A thick skin would help (I don't have one). The number of people who will free-ride is very high, and even some very deep pocketed organizations will free-ride. This is deeply annoying when you see individuals and smaller organizations coming to the table generously, but there is nothing to be done about it.</li> </ul> So now we are done, the <a href="http://www.refractions.net/news/index.php?file=20051003.data">press release</a> is written, and hopefully we will have an article about this on <a href="http://programming.newsforge.com/programming/05/10/12/1815254.shtml">Newsforge</a> soon!";s:4:"link";s:64:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2005/10/concurrency-for-postgis.html";s:9:"link_self";s:66:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/112926115412284030";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/112926115412284030";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:24;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:58:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-112887613347300606";s:9:"published";s:29:"2005-10-09T09:37:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-10-21T11:22:57.501-07:00";s:5:"title";s:30:"Simple Web Services Catalogues";s:12:"atom_content";s:4417:"Web services are a "big deal" these days, garnering lots and lots of column inches in mainstream <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/05/06/HNfinalsoapanel_1.html">IT magazines</a>.  The geospatial world is no exception: after years of stagnation the number of number of <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC) web services publicly available on the internet is starting to really explode, going from around 200 to 1000 over the last nine months.<br /><br />Great news! Except... now we have to find the services so we can use them in clients. The web services mantra is "publish, find, bind". "Publish" is going great guns, "bind" is working well with good <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/">servers</a> and <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/">clients</a>, but "find"... now that is another story.<br /><br />The OGC has a specification for a "<a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=5929&version=1">Catalogue Services for the Web</a>" (CSW), which is supposed to fill in the "find" part, but:<br /><p></p> <ul><li>It is 180 pages long;<br /></li><li>You also need a "<a href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=7048">profile</a>" for services, another 40 pages; and,<br /></li><li>The profile catalogues information at a "service" level, rather than at a "layer" level.</li></ul>The OGC specification is designed to handle a large number of use cases, most of which are irrelevant to spatial web services clients currently in action. By designing for the future, they may have foreclosed on the present, because there are <strong>much easier</strong> ways to get at catalogue information than via CSW.<br /><br />For example, if you want a quick raw listing of spatial web services, try this link:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=inurl%3Arequest%3Dgetcapabilities">http://www.google.ca/search?q=inurl:request=getcapabilities</a><br /><br />Instant gratification, and you did not have to read a single page of the CSW standard!<br /><br />With a little <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, some <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> you can turn the results of the above into a neat layer-by-layer database and allow people to query it with a very simple URL-based API:<br /><br /><a href="http://udig.refractions.net/search/google-xml.php?keywords=robin&xmin=-180&amp;ymin=-90&xmax=180&amp;ymax=90">http://udig.refractions.net/search/google-xml.php<br />?keywords=robin<br />&amp;xmin=-180<br />&ymin=-90<br />&amp;xmax=180<br />&ymax=90</a><br /><br />This kind of simple catalogue access became a clear necessity while we were building <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/">uDig</a> -- there were no CSW servers available with a population of publicly available services, and in any event the CSW profiles did not allow us to search for information <em>by layer</em>, the fundamental unit of interactive mapping.<br /><br />By using this simple API and properly populated catalogue, we turned <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/">uDig</a> into a client that implemented all the elements of the publish-find-bind paradigm, and exposed them with a drag-and-drop user interface. A user types a keyword into the <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/">uDig</a> search panel, selects a result from the return list, and drags it into the map panel, where it automatically loads.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/8171/1363/1600/screenshot_011.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/8171/1363/400/screenshot_01.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So where does this leave the OGC catalogue effort? Still waiting for clients. There are server implementions from the vendors who sponsored the profile effort, but the client implementations are the usual web-based show'n'tell clients, not clients cleanly integrated into actual GIS software. All web services standardization efforts have a chicken-and-egg quality to them, as the network effects of the standard do not become apparent until a critical mass of deployed clients can hit a critical mass of populated servers. Both halves of the equation are required: useful clients, and useful servers.";s:4:"link";s:71:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2005/10/simple-web-services-catalogues.html";s:9:"link_self";s:66:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/112887613347300606";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/112887613347300606";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}}s:7:"channel";a:10:{s:2:"id";s:34:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2007-02-15T00:16:39.379-08:00";s:5:"title";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/index.html";s:9:"link_next";s:77:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?start-index=26&max-results=25";s:42:"link_http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed";s:47:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"link_self";s:47:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";s:9:"generator";s:7:"Blogger";s:10:"opensearch";a:2:{s:12:"totalresults";s:2:"27";s:10:"startindex";s:1:"1";}}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:0:{}s:9:"feed_type";s:4:"Atom";s:12:"feed_version";N;s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:13:"current_field";s:0:"";s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:13:"last_modified";s:31:"Thu, 15 Feb 2007 08:16:39 GMT
