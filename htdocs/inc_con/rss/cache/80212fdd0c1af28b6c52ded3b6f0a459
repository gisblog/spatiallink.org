I surrounded it with a couple of chairs and attempted to make realistic bookshelves using photos of from the shelves in my living room.  Circling above the walls you see the digital version of the model airplane which I made with my father when I was barely old enough to use glue in a safe manner.</p>

<p>To the right of the desk is my plazes plaque, which uses the Plazes.com feeds to indicate where I am based on which wireless network my laptop uses.</p>

<p>To the left is my whiteboard, where I can quickly post screengrabs or image files for other people to see during meetings.</p>

<p>On the other side of the office is the sofa area with a view of the space needle and my motion test turned art piece, which has a mesmerizing effect when you see it in action. </p>

<p>I'm working on a display table for downtown Seattle.  That's a miniature space needle poking up on the top left, and eventually I'll add a landscape texture and elevation grid so that the buildings look out over a tiny Elliot Bay.</p>

<p>We bought a house recently and in some small way I feel that the creation of my online office has been a part of moving into our new home.</p>
