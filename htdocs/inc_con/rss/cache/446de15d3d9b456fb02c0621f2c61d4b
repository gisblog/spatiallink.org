Yahoo! Real Estate is happy to announce that you can now search for schools in your area (or the area you plan to move into) and evaluate which schools are the best fit for your kids, based on detailed school information, statistics, and parent reviews. Now that’s useful!<br />
Here’s how to start:<br />
- Go to Yahoo! Real Estate<br />
- Click on the “Research Schools” tab</p>

<p>- Enter the city and state or ZIP code for the area that you’re researching in the search box and click “Search.”<br />
- Now you’ll be able to view this region’s schools on the map and in the list.  You can refine your search by school district, school level (elementary, middle, and high schools), and school type (public, private, and charter schools) on the left bar.</p>

<p>Since we released the beta version, we’ve spent our time optimizing the product and responding to user feedback to make it ready for mainstream use. We added the functionality and features our users want most, and the response we’ve received to-date has been very positive. The new Yahoo! Maps gives our users a more expedient method of finding locations and getting driving directions, and is an even more powerful tool within <a title="Yahoo! Local" href="http://local.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Local</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to releasing the new Yahoo! Maps, we&#8217;re also rolling out street-level maps for Europe and many cities of new satellite imagery. These are available almost anywhere Yahoo! Maps can be found, whether on Flickr in their <a href="http://flickr.com/map">photo mapping feature</a>, Yahoo! Travel&#8217;s <a title="Yahoo! Travel Trip Planner" href="http://travel.yahoo.com/trip?action=explore">Trip Planner</a> product, and of course to our external developer community using <a title="Yahoo! Developer Network" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/">Yahoo! Maps APIs</a>.  Getting more maps and imagery outside the US is a feature enhancement that has been in high demand.</p>
<p>Just a quick re-cap of what’s in the new Yahoo! Maps.</p>

<li>Multi-point routing, (from A to B to C), which is a great way to plan your day, do your errands, visit garage sales or hunt for a house.</li>
<li>A new mini-map which gives you an overview of what you’re looking at.</li>
<li>Satellite and Aerial imagery, wall to wall in the USA, and for over 100 cities internationally.</li>
<li>Full integration with Yahoo! Local, including search and SmartView.</li>
<li>Saved locations and auto-complete against your saved locations, recent locations and Yahoo! Address Book.</li>
<li>The ability to return to the old-style Yahoo! Maps for when you’re on a Dial-Up connection.</li>
<li>Quick access to maps from within Yahoo! Mail using <a title="Yahoo! Shortcuts" href="http://help.yahoo.com/us/mail/shortcuts/">Yahoo! Shortcuts</a>.</li>

<p>We certainly hope you enjoy using the new Yahoo! Maps, and the Maps team will continue to work to make it faster, more enjoyable, and more useful.  Please <a title="Yahoo!
