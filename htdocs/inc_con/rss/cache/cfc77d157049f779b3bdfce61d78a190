The best came on the first day, with the plenary session talks, and the Mass Market meeting, with the entrance of <a href='http://earth.google.com'>Google Earth</a>'s <a href='http://earth.google.com/kml/'>KML</a> into the OGC.<br /><br />I attempted to capture Michael Jones' (CTO Google) explanation verbatim, but am not a professional stenographer. So take the below as a loose quotation:<blockquote>"Why go this far [submitting KML to OGC]? So we could go further. A lot of people are using Google Earth. It is thrilling to us. It [KML] is a pretty standard format, even though it is vendor controlled.  It seemed to us like the Microsoft Word .doc format.  Will become more and more a de facto standard. If we could put it into a standards body, they could shape it. It would be a better outcome. We wanted [KML to be] HTML for the geospatial web. Our fledgling efforts have got us this far.  We don't want to bail on this [continuing development of KML], but will support a standards effort in the future."</blockquote><blockquote>"We thought we could codify the current state [of KML]. And then over the next while work together to build a new KML that is a lot like the current KML, but would be built according to the standards body process. Between here and there, could be mid-points, stops along the way, but that is the path. This [submitting KML 2.1 to the OGC] is not the whole activity, it is the first step along the way."</blockquote>The quotation captures Jones' excitement about the potential of KML as an interchange format, a way of sharing and linking geospatial data.  The process of bringing KML into the OGC will be:<ul><li>The OGC will develop a "position paper" explaining how KML relates to the OGC standards baseline.<br /><li>KML 2.1 will be re-published as an official OGC "best practices document".<br /><li>The OGC Mass Market working group will begin working on KML 3.0.<br /><li>In the meantime, Google may add changes to the KML 2.X stream, and the OGC Mass Market group will decide whether they are worthy of propagation into KML 3.0.</ul>The whole process is anticipated to take less than a year.<br /><br />The pivot on which all this turns is the idea that KML is similar to HTML, as a content encoding that will be consumed by multiple clients ("spatial browsing software"), not just Google Earth.  The market already seems to be well on the way to that end state &mdash; there are lots of KML consumers (ArcGIS, FME, World Wind) and producers (ArcServer, PostGIS, Mapguide).  Given such an emerging market, KML will be healthier and grow even faster under third-party control (OGC) than under corporate control (Google).<br /><br />There were some questions after. <br /><br />The OGC has spent a good deal of time and effort carefully separating concerns in their standards: there are content encoding standards (GML), and styling standards (SLD), and filtering standards (Filter), and behavior standards (WMS/WFS), and they have been carefully kept separate.  KML merrily stuffs all those concerns into one pot.  Asked about this disconnect, Google reps were unapologetic, saying that the very combination of concerns allows for the simple user experience which makes Google Earth (and by extension KML) so compelling. I agree.  Bundling the concerns together makes deployment simple, and does not preclude the over-riding of styling, etc, by the client software.<br /><br />I had to ask the question that was on my mind: if KML 2.1 was going to be an OGC "best practices" document, but Google was going to continue to add features to the 2.X series of KML, how would the KML 3.0 work re-converge? Basically, was the OGC just going to end up rubber-stamping whatever features Google felt like tossing into the 2.X series in the period prior to the 3.0 release.<br /><br />Michael Jones answered that vendor extensions are a time honored part of the standards development process, that the innovation around standards is what drives them forward. Citing his time in the OpenGL process, Jones noted that companies would add proprietary extensions to their hardware that were not in the standard, but that the worthy extensions would end up pulled into the standard at the next revision. I replied that there was  only one vendor in this case, Google, which made for an unhealthy balance of power.  Jones said he had approached Microsoft and ESRI to join in the standardization process of KML, and will continue to invite them to the table.  In the end, an OGC process with Google and invitations to the others is better than no process at all.   I find it hard to disagree with that.<br /><br />A similar process has driven development of HTML &mdash; it is not always pretty, and sometime people yell at each other, but in the end the standard moves forward and everyone has a known baseline to work against.  With more and more applications using and creating KML, it is important for companies to have a solid baseline they can trust.";s:4:"link";s:48:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/04/kml-ogc.html";s:9:"link_self";s:67:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4305803103020679304";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/4305803103020679304";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:2;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-7265212042521367304";s:9:"published";s:29:"2007-04-10T13:58:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2007-04-10T14:16:02.168-07:00";s:5:"title";s:30:"FOSS4G 2007 Registration Open!";s:12:"atom_content";s:1593:"Another milestone past!

However, it had some redeeming features, notably the brunch, and the diverse set of presentations from 3D world bigwigs to the closing plenary sessions.<br /><br />Erik Weiker of Microsoft, Michael Jones of Google Earth, and Patrick Hogan of NASA World Wind all gave talks, pushing their various globes within the context of talking about what the future of such technology holds.<ul><li><strong>Arik Weiker</strong> of Microsoft had the weakest talk, presentation-wise, as I cannot remember much of it now (typing in the airport bar in Vancouver, waiting for my flight to Victoria). He showed off some nice mash-ups in Virtual Earth, gave a little tour of the app, and pointed up the different between "GIS as practiced by GIS'ers" and "GIS as experienced by ordinary folks".  His grandma figured prominently as a user story.<br /><li><strong>Michael Jones</strong> of Google gave a clean, crowd pleasing talk that was long on laughs but short on content. The core was similar to Arik's, pointing up the massive size of the audience represented by the aggregate number of Google Earth downloads (over 200 million at this time). His take away message was that the size of this new audience of geospatial consumers represents a <strong>huge</strong> opportunity for geospatial content providers. And since the audience consisted of a lot of folks who manage and create geospatial content (government agencies largely), it was a worthy message.  GIS &mdash; it ain't just about printing maps anymore.<br /><li><strong>Patrick Hogan</strong> of NASA was the final speaker, and had a different message, though with similar overtones. Again, the idea was the virtual globes are bringing geospatial to the masses.  Hogan highlighted the role that World Wind can/is playing in providing an open platform for delivering this content.  Because World Wind is open source, and leverages open standards (like WMS), it is (hopefully) leading the virtual globe market to the same standards convergence that NCSA Mosaic led the web browser world through a scant 15 years ago.<br /></ul>Sam and I left before the talk from Sean Walsh, advisor to the Governator, and headed  off.

Mid-morning, the short sessions started again.<br /><br />Justin Lokitz, formerly of Oracle, now of Acquis, gave what must be his standard talk on "enterprise geospatial".  For someone who understands the technology, his talk is a bit disconcerting, because he kept talking about moving spatial features from device to database to on-screen map and saying "this does not involve GIS, you do not need a GIS to do this".  After a while though, I understood that while he was saying "GIS", he really meant "ESRI".  By using the generic term, he was attempting to inoculate against the strong bias in the (standard US spatial user/manager) audience to think that any kind of spatial data work requires ESRI products.  His general point was that you could build an application that gathered and managed spatial data using (<em>gasp</em>) only a spatial database a rendering engine and some user interface glue.  The examples were Acquis apps, but of course the concept carries over the any number of other mixes of technology.<br /><br />Next up was another (!!) Farallon consultant, with an app that appeared to automate data interchange between a cost modeling application, GIS database, and scenario manager. A bit of a hair-ball, to say the least, but apparently quite successful at streamlining an ugly prioritization process for road maintenance dollars.<br /><br />Completing my tour of the Farallon (!!!) staff, was a talk from Adam Lodge, which recapitulated the points they raised on their day one talks, about the many benefits of building business apps against the Google/Yahoo/Microsoft APIs.  Adam added some points about the usefulness of open source components that his colleagues largely omitted from their talks. I spoke with him briefly after the talk, and he is a recent refuge from county GIS &mdash; he seems to be enjoying his new freedom to work with a range of tools.<br /><br />A panel discussion on the "future of GIS in government" with folks from San Francisco, counties, and CalTrans was notable for how often "open source" was raised as a point of future investigation and priority.  For the managers with keen young staff, doings lots of hands-on exploring, I think great things are ahead. For those who are going to download some stuff, dump it on a server and "see what it does", I predict disappointment.  Much of this flows from organizational dynamics, vibrant interesting people do vibrant interesting things, and attract like-minded colleagues.<br /><br />Sam gave his conflation talk at the end of the afternoon sessions (the "golden hour" *cough*) and was well received. Conflation does not get the respect it deserves. Operational GIS folks thinks that you just need to apply enough clicking desktop monkeys. Algorithmic GIS folks think that it can be automated away into a cloud of digits. In fact, it inhabits a nasty gray area, with unanticipated special cases, the politics of "who's data is 'right'", and algorithmic possibilities all colliding in an interesting stew.  Sam's talk is about how to cook that stew so that it's possible to consume it and survive.<br /><br />The evening included a stroll down to Jack London Square, not worth writing home about (oops), and then dinner at a super fabulous <a href='http://www.tamarindoantojeria.com/'>Mexican tapas restaurant</a> (mmmmmmm) just a couple block from the conference center, very much worth writing home about.<br /><br />And so, to bed.";s:4:"link";s:59:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/04/calgis-notes-day-2.html";s:9:"link_self";s:67:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/4216918400236914419";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/4216918400236914419";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:6;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-7284315790630491684";s:9:"published";s:29:"2007-04-04T22:22:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2007-04-04T23:01:37.265-07:00";s:5:"title";s:19:"CalGIS Notes: Day 1";s:12:"atom_content";s:5296:"I am attending CalGIS, the California GIS conference, this year in lovely Oakland. Sam Smith and I are manning a Refractions booth on the trade show floor, or rather, Sam is manning the booth most of the time and graciously allowing me to go to whatever talks strike my fancy.<br /><br />Counting on my thumbs, attendance appears to be around 400 to 500, with about 100 of those folks associated with the sponsors on the exhibition floor.<br /><br />Quick notes on talks:<ul><li>Keynote from Dave Sonnen, IGN analyst. Sonnen is the big name in industry analysts for geospatial, is suitably well connected, and has big generic things to say. Analysts are supposed to predict the future, so the big takeaways are the five things Sonnen says will change the direction of the industry over the next few years.<ul><li>Full spatial data search, the first glimmerings of which we are seeing with the new Google KML search<li>Entry of old-line IT firms into geospatial with "good enough" products to hold onto their existing customer base while adding spatial functionality. Oracle, SAP, IBM, etc. We're already seeing this with Oracle adding their own map renderer, their own slippy map user interface, etc, to their spatial offerings<li>Shortage of skilled geospatial workers<li>Spatial data quality becoming a core concern (I imagine lots of people taking the georeferencing of base maps from the consumer mapping providers as gospel will do wonders for creating data of poor quality)<li><strong>Open source</strong> changing the relationship between vendors and customers</ul>Sonnen really talked up open source, not just in that part of the talk, but others as well, mentioning World Wind as an example of a must-see open source geospatial app. Needless to say, I made sure to button-hole him and invite him to <a href='http://www.foss4g2007.org/'>FOSS4G 2007</a>.<br /><li>I caught the tail end of a talk from a Microsoft rep on Virtual Earth. The most interesting bit was a question at the end, asking what he thought made VE better than Google Maps/Earth. He said oblique photos, web browser integration of 3D, roof-top geocoding (said they got data from corporate partners, Fedex, UPS, DHL, who GPSed addresses at delivery time), and better routing (because their data was NavTeq, driven, not TeleAtlas, compiled).  The latter points feed into some of the (none-too-subtle) language coming out of the <a href='http://virtualearth4gov.spaces.live.com/Blog/'>Virtual Earth for Government</a> blog, which avers that Microsoft is doing great work on data quality. We'll see.<br /><li>The Autodesk Map3D product manager gave a good talk on open source, focusing mostly on FDO, and how being open source was benefiting Autodesk and its customers, by providing a faster release cycle and new features from the community. A good talk, it seem well pitched to me, but some of the audience still seemed confused about the idea of a data access abstraction library. It's hard to talk software library concepts to folks who understand software as something that appears on your screen, no matter how carefully you pitch the message. One question: "does FDO run on the desktop, or on the server"? Both, the presenter gently explained.<br /><li>Very nicely presented talk from a Farralon consultant on a basic Virtual Earth web mapping project they did for Boston Redevelopment. Good thoughts on resisting creeping featuritis, focusing on the real end user and stopping there. Good demonstration of the value-adds you get for free building on the VE API (or, as the presenter noted, the GMaps or Yahoo APIs).  Good free base data, geocoding, nice UI.  Some very nice shots of how VE provides multiple views of the same data.  They put some red data dots on their map (<em>yawn</em>), flipped to oblique and there the dots are on the side of the buildings (<em>huh?</em>), flipped to 3D and there the dots are on the tops of the 3D buildings (<em>nice!</em>). Very impressive demonstration of how VE ties together the three views under one API.<br /><li>Afternoon talk from CalTrans on their use of Google Earth. They bought the Whole Enchilada, a complete Google Enterprise license ($200K, he said). Looks like they have a good quantity of their live data accessible to their staff via the interface now, some good pretty pictures. Interesting, gave some reasons for not going with other 3D options: ArcGIS Explorer, too vertically integrated, tied into other ESRI things, trying to get their IT more diversified (I guess you <em>can</em> have too much of a good thing); World Wind, harder to use, more "scientist oriented"; Virtual Earth, more business-to-business or business-to-customer oriented. I just report the news, ma'am.<br /><li>Finally, a talk from a Google employee on KML Regions. Nothing I did not know already, or you could not learn from the API documentation, but a nice overview of what can be done. I'm looking forward to playing with this technology more, particularly in the relatively untapped field of publishing large amounts of <em>vector</em> data progressively via super-overlays.</ul>Took the BART over the San Francisco for a little evening stroll through the city, had dinner at a "gourmet burger" place on Polk, and BARTed back.

(The only function I have found to have been removed is an old point point-in-polygon function from the very early versions called truly_inside().)<br /><br />Here are some things that I think it would be wise to pursue going forward:<ul><li>Complete SQL/MM support. We already have a <a href='http://postgis.refractions.net/docs/ch06.html#id3062986'>good deal</a> of it, to provide compatibility with SDE (should SDE wish to provide spatial SQL access to PostGIS).  We will need to complete curve support to get substantially closer.<li>Clean up function names, deprecate old OGC function names and move to using XX_ prefixes to define where the functions come from.  ST_ for SQL/MM, SE_ for SDE-specific, PGIS_ for PostGIS specific, etc.<li>Automagic indexes. Wrap all the ST_ functions in index magic so that Contains(A,B) kicks in the index automatically.<li>Automagic geographic support. More controversially, recognize when simple spatial ops are being called on lat/lon features and apply appropriate translations to do them in a planar system, or on a sphere/spheroid. The danger here is that in pleasing the crowd, we will quietly confuse a small number of people for whom the automagic assumptions are wrong.<li>Update documentation. PostGIS is now far in advance of its last serious documentation update. The reference material is all correct, but the tutorial level stuff needs to be updated. All the examples work, but they are not the "right" way to do things anymore.  Particularly important if we start deprecating old function names.</ul>It is a bit over-the-top to call the above changes "next generation", because only one of them (full SQL/MM curvepolygon support) would involve touching the core object representation.

I'm assuming that this will be the same with PostGRES.</blockquote>No doubt, there are lots of (too many?) geometry options available with ArcSDE already. And a look at how the options are distributed between the various host databases raises some interesting questions:<ul><li>Oracle<ul><li>SDEBINARY (ESRI)<li>SDO_GEOMETRY (Native)<li>ST_GEOMETRY (ESRI)</ul></li><li>DB2<ul><li>SDEBINARY (ESRI)<li>ST_GEOMETRY (Native)</ul></li><li>Informix<ul><li>SDEBINARY (ESRI)<li>ST_GEOMETRY (Native)</ul></li><li>SQL Server<ul><li>SDEBINARY (ESRI)</ul></li><li>PostgreSQL<ul><li>SDEBINARY (ESRI)<li>GEOMETRY (Native)<li>ST_GEOMETRY (ESRI)</ul></ul>Why does ESRI use the native geometry implementations for Informix and DB2 and not provide their own special implementation?  I would posit that the DB2 and Informix implementations, put out by close business partner IBM (and, if I am not misled, implemented in large part by ESRI itself), are perceived as "friendlies". <br /><br />Why do they provide a special implementation for Oracle? The Oracle native geometry is controlled by an aggressive corporation with a competitive chip on its shoulder that has been actively hustling to elbow ESRI out of some of its traditional turf.  I had the privilege of being part of a "bake off" a year ago. Me, the local ESRI reps, and an Oracle rep, all gave presentations about the relative merits of our spatial database solutions.  The Oracle presentation was notable in its head-on attack on the many disadvantages of "proprietary middleware" (read, "ArcSDE").  They gave no quarter.  I assume no love is lost on the ESRI side of the fence either.<br /><br />So, if using the native geometry type is what ESRI does with its friends, and dumping a "special" spatial type in is that they do with their enemies, how is a rational observer to interpret the inclusion of a new PostgreSQL spatial type with the 9.3 ArcSDE PostgreSQL support?<br /><br />There is no technical reason to do it, that I can see &mdash; PostGIS already supports all the function signatures that the Informix and DB2 spatial implementations do. All that is left is company strategy. Apparently, PostGIS is considered beyond their control and potentially hostile (like Oracle's SDO_GEOMETRY) so they are including a route-around in the form of their own type.<br /><br />I have contacted the folks at ESRI to try and clear this up, but no response yet. Because PostGIS is open source, there should not be a <em>need</em> for a strategic route around us. ESRI can join the community and submit whatever functionality they require, and they don't have to get down on their knees and beg, the way they would with Oracle.";s:4:"link";s:70:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/03/more-on-spatial-types-and-sde.html";s:9:"link_self";s:66:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/328876575914837864";s:9:"link_edit";s:70:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/328876575914837864";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:11;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-8204647785512939523";s:9:"published";s:29:"2007-03-15T04:44:00.000-07:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2007-03-15T04:55:28.337-07:00";s:5:"title";s:38:"Some good news... and some bad news...";s:12:"atom_content";s:1544:"Some more details on the upcoming ArcSDE support for PostgreSQL are living in <a href="http://events.esri.com/uc/QandA/index.cfm?ConferenceID=3B67AFC7-D566-ED85-A18E8EFF9B63B57B">the Q&A page</a> for the upcoming Developers Summits (as pointed out by <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2007/03/13/esri-posts-the-developer-summit-qa/">James Fee</a>).<br /><br />First there's the old news:<blockquote>ArcGIS Server (ArcSDE technology) will support the PostgreSQL database at the ArcGIS 9.3 release.</blockquote>Then there's the good news:<blockquote>The enterprise geodatabase and all of its standard capabilities will be fully supported.

This is a great chance for ESRI to articulate some kind of framework for co-existence with open source alternatives, and for the open source community to educate ESRI on the options for interoperability.<br /><br />At a minimum, we'll be hearing from ESRI folks about deployment in "less traditional" IT environments, using Linux operating systems and PostgreSQL databases.  Hopefully we will get lucky and Scott Morehouse can attend and provide a bit more of a strategic story about where ESRI sees themselves going relative to open source.<br /><br />OK, that's the low-test factual line, now the high-test opinion...<br /><br />ESRI has two options on creating a relationship with open source.  They are the big dominant player on the geospatial field, so they have two mainstream analogues they can follow in formulating their open source strategy:<ul><li><b>Microsoft:</b> ESRI could follow the Microsoft model, and use desktop leverage and negative messaging to try retain full-spectrum market dominance.  Let's call this strategy "Destroy! Destroy!".<br /></li><li><b>Oracle:</b> ESRI could follow the Oracle model and work on migrating their core revenue away from functional areas where open source is commoditizing the market. Oracle is spending most of their money on building and buying vertical apps (CRM, Financials, etc) that add business value on the database core. Oracle is already well on the way through the transition from "database company" to "business intelligence company". Call this strategy the "Pragmatic Realist" approach.</li></ul>Because ESRI currently has such full-spectrum dominance in the geospatial area, it is hard for them to make any space for open source in their product line in the way that Autodesk did with Mapguide. Uneasy coexistence is the likely model for some time, hopefully in the "realist" mode of Oracle rather than the "destroy! destroy!" mode of Microsoft.";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2007/03/esri-foss4g-2007.html";s:9:"link_self";s:67:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/6100858478483070673";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/6100858478483070673";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:13;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-9103576698170581216";s:9:"published";s:29:"2007-03-01T09:14:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2007-03-01T09:31:17.268-08:00";s:5:"title";s:16:"FOSS4G 2007 News";s:12:"atom_content";s:1523:"Lots of interesting tidbits from the conference organizing front:<ul><li>We have added <a href='http://www.leica-geosystems.com'>Leica Geosystems</a> as a <a href='http://www.foss4g2007.org'>sponsor</a>.

You can physically get your hands on them by <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=downloads.patchesServicePacks.viewPatch&PID=19&MetaID=1198">downloading a service pack</a> and pulling them out of there.  For whatever reason, there is no click through license and no license included in the service packs, so those who live by the letter of the law might feel fine just using them as found.<br /><br />Those of us living by the spirit of the law need to go one level deeper.  We have an ESRI Developer Network package, so I pulled out the SDE developer kit disk and installed the Java clients.  The license I had to agree to in that process did not say anything specific about the client libraries, so I assume they are covered in the general license, which is pretty explicit:<blockquote>Licensee shall not redistribute the Software, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, extensions, components, or DLLs without the prior written approval of ESRI as set forth in an appropriate redistribution license agreement.</blockquote>Looks like black-letter law to me.<br /><br />Like Oracle, ESRI is missing out on an opportunity to grow an ecosystem of dependent open source client applications.  As Howard Butler <a href="http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/12/not-so-free-client-libraries.html#comments">points out in a comment</a>, proprietary companies like LizardTech let open source projects ship their SDK clients with their builds.

I answered, citing the pains that <a href="http://www.geotools.org">Geotools</a> (and by extension <a href="http://geoserver.sourceforge.net">Geoserver</a> and <a href="http://udig.refractions.net">uDig</a>) have to go to in supporting Oracle servers while not distributing the actual Oracle JDBC JAR files.  Because we can't include Oracle libraries with our builds, end users have to independently download the JARs and copy them into the right places themselves -- it is not a user-friendly situation at all.<br /><br />"But", Xaviar replied, "they <b>are</b> redistributable."<br /><br />This did not match my understanding of the situation, but he <i>is</i> the expert. So I said I would look into it and get back to him.<br /><br />The source of our mutual misunderstanding turned out to be (surprise!) based on legaleze.  As Xaviar said, the client JDBC JARs <b>are</b> freely redistributable... but there is a catch.  You can only get the JARs in the first place by accepting a license, and the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/htdocs/distlic.html?url=http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/htdocs/jdbc_10201.html">license</a> says that you are allowed to redistribute them only if you do so under the same terms as those given in the original Oracle license.<br /><br />Among the restrictions which any open source project would have to place on its users if they wanted to redistribute the Oracle client libraries are:<blockquote><ul><li>You are not a citizen, national, or resident of, and are not under control of, the government of Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Libya, North Korea, Syria, nor any country to which the United States has prohibited export.<br /><li>You will not download or otherwise export or re-export the Programs, directly or indirectly, to the above mentioned countries nor to citizens, nationals or residents of those countries.<br /><li>You are not listed on the United States Department of Treasury lists of Specially Designated Nationals, Specially Designated Terrorists, and Specially Designated Narcotic Traffickers, nor are you listed on the United States Department of Commerce Table of Denial Orders.<br /><li>You will not download or otherwise export or re-export the Programs, directly or indirectly, to persons on the above mentioned lists.</ul></blockquote>To abide by the  license, not only would we have to to (somehow) ensure that none of the people downloading our builds met the conditions above, but we would also have to get them to promise in turn not to distribute to such people. Forcing the users to copy the JARs by hand starts to look a whole lot better all of a sudden.<br /><br />(Stop. Take a moment to contemplate the lush absurdity of the idea that placing a piece of software behind such a click-through license materially assists the enforcement of export controls in any way. Breath in. Breath out. Ahhhh.)<br /><br />Open source cannot place restrictions on use or redistribution.  It is the ethos.  It is the way things work.  It is not because the restrictions in this case are oddball notions from the national security state.  Any such restrictions are anathema.  My favourite case of this was a piece of Geotools, which had to be re-written when it turned out that a component was licensed under a "public domain except for military use" clause.  Everyone gets to download, use and redistribute open source.

Doing the budgeting and planning just to put together the bid has been very educational.  I has been a good reminder of the value of working with professionals -- the conference center staff and organizer I am working with pulled together the background information and base budget with magical ease.  Everyone has their area of expertise, and it is sure nice to have experts on your side when entering a domain in which you know nothing at all!<br /><br />Then I talked with Mark about pushing PostGIS 1.2.0 out the door, and we did!  Curve support started, some performance hooks I've been wanting for a while, and function signatures to allow easy integration with other SQL/MM database software (this means you, ArcSDE!).  <br /><br />The performance stuff is fun, because I know there will be more -- for every generic spatial predicate (Contains(), for example), there are lots of special cases that don't have to be handled with full computation.  If the bounding boxes of the inputs are disjoint, for example, you know Contains() is false without even starting anything involved.  If both arguments are points -- false!  If one argument is a point and the other is a polygon, you can do a point-in-polygon test instead of a full graph calculation needed for two more complex types. And on and on and on.<br /><br />Finally, I did a "Friday talk" about the history of the <a href='http://www.safe.com'>FME</a>, my favourite non-open source GIS tool.  Friday talks are something we try to do every week at Refractions -- have someone talk about a topic of interest to them that hopefully has some relevance to other folks in the company.  A programming technique, a project summary, a quirk of geography.  Grist for the mill.

Which, to PostGIS people like ourselves suggests the question: "implemented how?"<ul><li>One possibility would be basically a cut'n'paste of their existing SQLServer code, with the SQLServer quirks replaced with PostgreSQL quirks, using SDEBINARY as the spatial type.<br /><li>Another possibility would be to use the PostGIS spatial objects as the underlying storage mechanism, in the same way ArcSDE supports using SDO_GEOMETRY in Oracle.<br /><li>A third possibility would be ESRI implementing their own spatial type in PostgreSQL and then using that.</ul>Sounds strange, doesn't it? Writing a whole new spatial type, when one already exists. Ordinarily I would dismiss the idea -- except that ESRI has <b>already done it for Oracle!</b>.<br /><br />The <a href='http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=A_spatial_type_for_Oracle&anchor=ST_Geom'>ST_GEOMETRY</a> type in ArcSDE 9.1 and up is a native Oracle type (built using the Oracle type-extension mechanism) provided, and recommended, by ESRI for use by ArcSDE.<br /><br />Why would ESRI do this?  <br /><br />The cynical explanation (get this out of the way first) is that it helps break the growing Oracle momentum in tools supporting SDO_GEOMETRY, and confuses the marketplace further about what the "right type" to use is in Oracle for spatial work.  <br /><br />The practical explanation is that ESRI's ST_GEOMETRY for Oracle implements the same semantics and function signatures as the ST_GEOMETRY objects in DB2 and Informix (coincidentally, also implemented in part by ESRI).  This allows ArcSDE to expose a uniform "raw spatial SQL" to clients while still maintaining it's position as the man-in-the-middle of client/server interaction.  Adding ST_GEOMETRY further reinforces the "database neutral" aspect of ArcSDE by allowing spatial SQL without <a href="http://www.spatialdbadvisor.com/source_code">exposing the differences</a> between the SDO_GEOMETRY function signatures and the ST_GEOMETRY ones.<br /><br />So where does that leave PostGIS?  <em>Removing the practical excuses for not using PostGIS as the underlying geometry type as fast as possible.</em>  We have looked up the function signatures used by ArcSDE and <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2006-December/002391.html">implemented them</a> for the 1.1.7 release.<br /><br />If anyone on the ArcSDE team reads this and wants to talk about what else is needed to make PostGIS the default geometry type for ArcSDE-on-PostgreSQL, get in touch.

Nothing!<br /><br />One of the promises of <a href='http://udig.refractions.net'>uDig</a> is to be an "internet GIS", by which we mean a thick client system capable of consuming and integrating web services in a transparent and low-friction way.  The GIS equivalent of a web browser.  Web browsers use HTTP and HTML and CSS and Javascript to create a rich and compelling client/server interaction, regardless of the client/server pairing.  An internet GIS should use WMS and WFS and SLD to do the same thing, independent of vendor.<br /><br />So, we have been working long and hard on a true WFS client, one that can connect to <b>any</b> WFS and read/write the features therein without modification.  And here's the thing -- it is <b>waaaaaaay</b> harder than it should be.<br /><br />Here is why:<ol><li>First off, generic GML support is hard.  Every WFS exposes its own schema which in turn embeds GML, so a "GML parser" is actually a "generic XML parser that happens to also notice embedded GML", and the client has to be able to turn whatever odd feature collection the server exposes into its internal model to actually render and process it.  However, it is only a hard problem, not an impossible one, and we have solved it.<br /><li>The solution to supporting generic GML is to read the schema advertised by the WFS, and use that to build a parser for the document on the fly.  And this is where things get even harder: lots of servers advertise schemas that differ from the instance documents they actually produce.<ul><br /><li>The difference between schema and instance probably traces back to point #1 above. Because GML and XML schema are "hard", the developers make minor mistakes, and because there have not been generic clients around to heavily test the servers, the mistakes get out into the wild as deployed services.<br /></ul></ol>So, once you have cracked the GML parsing problem (congratulations!) you run headlong into the next problem. Many of the servers have bugs and don't obey the schema/instance contract -- they do not serve up the GML that they say they do.<br /><br />And now, if you aren't just building a university research project, you have a difficult decision. If you want to interoperate with the existing servers, you have to code exceptions around all the previously-deployed bugs.  <br /><br />Unfortunately, our much loved UMN Mapserver is both (a) one of the most widely deployed WFS programs and (b) the one with the most cases of schema/instance mismatch.  Mapserver is not the only law-breaker though, we have found breakages even in proprietary products that passed the CITE tests.<br /><br />All this before you even start editing features!<br /><br />The relative complexity of WFS (compared to, say, WMS) means that the scope of ways implementors can "get it wrong" is much much wider, which in turn radically widens the field of "special cases to handle" that any client must write.<br /><br />In some ways, this situation invokes to good old days of web browsers, when HTML purists argued that when encountering illegal HTML (like an unclosed tag) browsers should stop and spit up an error, while the browser writers themselves just powered through and tried to do a "best rendering" based on whatever crap HTML they happened to be provided with.";s:4:"link";s:60:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/2006/12/can-wfs-really-work.html";s:9:"link_self";s:67:"http://geotips.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/1664416474186599322";s:9:"link_edit";s:71:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/14903426/posts/default/1664416474186599322";s:11:"author_name";s:11:"Paul Ramsey";}i:24;a:9:{s:2:"id";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14903426.post-2734446781416812342";s:9:"published";s:29:"2006-11-16T21:15:00.000-08:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2006-11-16T22:09:30.578-08:00";s:5:"title";s:10:"Flame Bait";s:12:"atom_content";s:1678:"Why end the evening on a high note, when I can end it rancourously and full of bile!<br /><br />On the <a href='http://postgis.refractions.net/mailman/listinfo/postgis-users'>postgis-users</a> mailing list, Stephen Woodbridge <a href='http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2006-November/013880.html'>writes</a>:<blockquote>Can you describe what dynamic segmentation is?
