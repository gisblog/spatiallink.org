        It's really fascinating to see the emerging trends in building open systems today: <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">A9's
        Open Search</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Yahoo's Flickr</a>, <a href="http://search.msn.com">MSN's
        RSS Format </a>and so on. I'm so excited about these new trends, that now I really
        want to open up my <a href="http://www.feedmap.net">BlogMap service</a>; so what does
        it mean? Here are some thoughts:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Have simple <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr like APIs with
        ReST</a>&#160;to update your blog location and post new blogs with their locations?
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Support <a href="http://www.feedmap.net/blogmap/search.aspxhttp://www.feedmap.net/blogmap/search.aspx">Search
        Blogs by Location </a>as RSS feeds?

        When wrote about <a href="http://www.csthota.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx/b30b936d-9c62-4dad-aa3b-f68f4af22a3b">7
        lessons learned last year</a>, I talked about (lesson #1) how blogs are becoming more
        influential in daily life. Here is what I wrote in that post:
    </p>
    <p>
        “Information is more interesting and powerful when it comes from genuine and disintegrated
        sources rather than media powerhouses: Yes, I'm talking about blogging. We have seen
        instances of this concept a couple of times in the year 2004 both about Iraq War and
        the Tsunami Relief.”
    </p>
    <p>
        I still feel very passionate about this. As a person who spends a lot of time reading
        blogs, I always wanted two things:<br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; a. Ability to search blogs based on a location<br />
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;b. Ability to “peek” at blog without navigating
        to them
    </p>
    <p>
        When I think about these requirements, the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cthota/archive/2004/04/11/111245.aspx">BlogMap
        project that I started last year </a>is exactly what it is – but it needed a total
        makeover. Finally, I could spend some time to rev this up to release <a href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/">BlogMap,
        Version 2.0</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some release notes:
    </p>
    <p>
        1.&#160;Redesigned the UI and backend significantly to improve performance. 
        <br />
        2.&#160;In the spirit my lessons learned from last year, I have used a lot of Javascript,
        at least in two scenarios:<br />
        &#160;&#160; a.&#160;To show “Blog Summary” balloons when you hover over the&#160;<img src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/mappointsdk/html/81-8,8.gif" /> icon<br />
        &#160; b.&#160;To show “Blog Peek” to display top (most recent)&#160; blog entry from
        the feed when you click on the “Blog Peek” (<img src="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/rightarrow.gif" />)
        button<br />
        3.&#160;Added new <a href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/blogapi.xml">BlogMap (querystring)&#160;API</a> –
        for now it only supports “BlogMap” method, but I have several ideas to add more features;
        stay tuned.<br />
        4.&#160;Added “My BlogMap” feature – now you can display your location using a stamp-sized
        MlogMap on your blog!<br />
        5.&#160;Implemented a <a href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/search.aspx">search
        feature </a>to do a proximity search for blogs around a given location.<br />
        6.&#160;A better <a href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/browse.aspx">browsing feature </a>to
        browse blogs by country.<br />

        application (81 out of 97); left out some broken feeds. If I have missed your feed,
        my apologies!

        So, try it out the new BlogMap here: <a href="http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/">http://www.csthota.com/blogmap/</a> and

        I need two things from you:<br />
        1.&#160;Feedback – send your comments, suggestions, bug reports to me; I want all
        of them!<br />
        2.&#160;Spread the word – Blog about BlogMap! I want more people to try it out, so
        that we can find blogs by location!

        When wrote about , I talked about (lesson #1) how blogs are becoming more
        influential in daily life. Here is what I wrote in that post:
    
        “Information is more interesting and powerful when it comes from genuine and disintegrated
        sources rather than media powerhouses: Yes, I'm talking about blogging. We have seen
        instances of this concept a couple of times in the year 2004 both about Iraq War and
        the Tsunami Relief.”
    
        I still feel very passionate about this. As a person who spends a lot of time reading
        blogs, I always wanted two things:
              a. Ability to search blogs based on a location
              b. Ability to “peek” at blog without navigating
        to them
    
        When I think about these requirements, the is exactly what it is – but it needed a total
        makeover. Finally, I could spend some time to rev this up to release . 
    
        Here are some release notes:
    
        1. Redesigned the UI and backend significantly to improve performance. 
        
        2. In the spirit my lessons learned from last year, I have used a lot of Javascript,
        at least in two scenarios:
           a. To show “Blog Summary” balloons when you hover over the  icon
          b. To show “Blog Peek” to display top (most recent)  blog entry from
        the feed when you click on the “Blog Peek” ()
        button
        3. Added new  –
        for now it only supports “BlogMap” method, but I have several ideas to add more features;
        stay tuned.
        4. Added “My BlogMap” feature – now you can display your location using a stamp-sized
        MlogMap on your blog!
        5. Implemented a to do a proximity search for blogs around a given location.
        6. A better to
        browse blogs by country.
        7. Finally, ported most of the existing (registered) blogs from my old BlogMap
        application (81 out of 97); left out some broken feeds. If I have missed your feed,

        I have been getting feedback to add more context around my "very-abstract" lessons
        I learned post; so here is my second attempt to add more context and meaning around
        them:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Information is more interesting and powerful when it comes from genuine and disintegrated
        sources rather than media powerhouses&#160;: Yes, I'm talking about blogging. We have
        seen instances of this concept a couple of times in the year 2004 both about <a href="http://www.command-post.org/">Iraq
        War </a>and the <a href="http://tsunamihelp.blogspot.com/">Tsunami Relief</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        2. Adding a little bit of JavaScript improves web UI experience dramatically&#160;:
        Gmail has this excellent client-side script that makes it a pleasure to use the web
        UI. Same goes for Google-Suggest as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        3. Simplicity (of a feature in a product)&#160;is always a winner - especially over
        richness (of a feature in a product) : Again, Google is a the best example to learn
        from this. Their features are simple but yet very compelling and successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Building user-friendly APIs that do not allow silly-human errors is really hard
        : Consider this for example; say for example you want to build an API to open a file
        by name. how do you do it? Something like this?
    </p>
    <p>
        File f&#160; = File.Open(string fileName);
    </p>
    <p>
        or something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        FileSpecifications fileSpecs = File.GetAllFiles();
    </p>
    <p>
        FileSpecification fileSpec = fileSpecs[0];
    </p>
    <p>
        File f = File.Open(FileSpecification fileSpec);
    </p>
    <p>
        Which one is more usable? which one is more error prone?
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        5. Innovation can come in a plain-white-plastic box and still be very successful :
        One word - IPod
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        6. Talking about algorithms can be sexy - at least anything related to 'search' :
        Well, no explanation is necessary for this one!
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        7. Just be thankful for everyday and enjoy it to the fullest extent; you just never
        know what's going to happen tomorrow : The devastation caused by the recent Tsunami
        reminds us how tiny we are compared to the grand scheme of things - just a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, again, do argee with me on these? Or do you feel I missed any other obvious lessons
        from the year 2004?

        3. Simplicity (of a feature in a product)&#160;is always a winner - especially over
        richness (of a feature in a product) : Again, Google is a the best example to learn
        from this. Their features are simple but yet very compelling and successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Building user-friendly APIs that do not allow silly-human errors is really hard
        : Consider this for example; say for example you want to build an API to open a file
        by name. how do you do it? Something like this?
    </p>
    <p>
        File f&#160; = File.Open(string fileName);
    </p>
    <p>
        or something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        FileSpecifications fileSpecs = File.GetAllFiles();
    </p>
    <p>
        FileSpecification fileSpec = fileSpecs[0];
    </p>
    <p>
        File f = File.Open(FileSpecification fileSpec);
    </p>
    <p>
        Which one is more usable? which one is more error prone?
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        5. Innovation can come in a plain-white-plastic box and still be very successful :
        One word - IPod
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        6. Talking about algorithms can be sexy - at least anything related to 'search' :
        Well, no explanation is necessary for this one!
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        7. Just be thankful for everyday and enjoy it to the fullest extent; you just never
        know what's going to happen tomorrow : The devastation caused by the recent Tsunami
        reminds us how tiny we are compared to the grand scheme of things - just a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, again, do argee with me on these? Or do you feel I missed any other obvious lessons
        from the year 2004?

        "Not only is Streets &amp; Trips 2005 with GPS Locator affordable and easy to use,
        but it also includes important fuel management and cost analysis features -- a valuable
        addition with the rising cost of gas. According to research from the Texas Transportation
        Institute at Texas A&amp;M University, Americans used 5.7 billion gallons of fuel
        and 3.5 billion hours sitting in traffic last year at a total cost of nearly $70 billion,
        or about $520 per driver in the 75 major cities surveyed.(2) Enhanced GPS support,
        accurate and up-to-date mapping data, options for customization, and Pocket Streets
        for Pocket PC and Smartphone work seamlessly to reduce travel-related stress and save
        valuable time and money by allowing consumers to plan their trip, their way. 
    </p>
    <b> 
    <p>
        The new GPS Locator makes it easier than ever to turn a laptop, Microsoft Windows
        Mobile(TM)-based Pocket PC or Smartphone into an all-inclusive GPS tracking device
    </p></b>.(3) Consumers simply plug the included GPS device into their laptop's USB
