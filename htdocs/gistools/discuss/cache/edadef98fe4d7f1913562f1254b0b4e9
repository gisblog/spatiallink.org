Using this feature involves setting up an Agent Controller on the remote server machine.  Agent Controller provides information about running applications to other applications for testing or debugging tools.  Considering the fact that WSAD is only available on Windows and Linux platforms and Agent Controller gets shipped with WSAD, I naturally thought that WSAD only supported remote attachment to servers on those platforms.  Turns out the following is true: </p>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;1. The remote platforms supported for remote deployment and test are Windows and Linux. </p>
	<p>However, for applications that are already deployed and running on remote platforms, the Agent Controller supports attaching to applications running on many other platforms, including AIX(R), Solaris, and OS/390(R).</p>
	<p>Here are the steps to get Agent Controller installed/uninstall on the Solaris platform.  </p>
	<p>Note:<br />
If you want to profile your applications on Solaris, ensure that Java development kit 1.3.0 or higher is installed.  To install or upgrade Agent Controller on a separate Solaris, follow these steps: </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Ensure that the Java development kit 1.3.0 or higher is installed. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Log in as root and go to the directory where Agent Controller setup.jar installation package that you transferred is located. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Issue the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -Djava.compiler=NONE -jar setup.jar</code></p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Follow the on-screen instructions. Here are some considerations when installing Agent Controller: </p>
	<p>By default, Agent Controller is installed in <code>/opt/IBMRAC</code> on Solaris.<br />
For the Specify where the Java Runtime file (java) is located prompt, type the location where java.exe can be found (for example, <code>/usr/java/jre/bin</code>).<br />
For the WebSphere Application Server V5 and V5.1 installed location prompt, type the locations of WebSphere Application Server Version 5 and WebSphere Application Server Version 5.1, if they installed (for example, <code>/usr/WebSphere/AppServer</code>). You may leave these fields blank if they are not installed.<br />
On the Host List page of the wizard, you specify computers that can access the Agent Controller you are currently installing. Usually these are the computers where WebSphere Studio Application Developer is installed.<br />
This computer only radio button does not allow any computer other than this one to access Agent Controller. This is the default.<br />
The Specific computers radio button allows you to specify the host name or the network name of one or more computers that can access Agent Controller. The host names are specified as a space delimited list.<br />
The Any computer radio button allows all computers to access Agent Controller.<br />
On the Security page of the wizard, specify whether Agent Controller will require encrypted and authenticated communications. If security is disabled, only the host list is used to control access to Agent Controller. If security is enabled, clients are able to connect to Agent Controller only if they contain the necessary certificates to authenticate Agent Controller for Secure Socket Communications. Also, all clients are required to log in to Agent Controller. If you select <em>Enabled</em>, you will be asked to enter the users that are allowed access to Agent Controller. Multiple user names must be separated by spaces. By default, security is disabled. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Start the server by opening the <code>/opt/IBMRAC/bin</code> directory and issuing the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>./RAStart.sh</code></p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To stop the server, open the <code>/opt/IBMRAC/bin</code> directory, and issue the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./RAStop.sh</p>
	<p>Uninstalling on Solaris<br />
To uninstall Agent Controller, ensure that the Java development kit is installed and log on as root. Go to the directory <code>/opt/IBMRAC/bin</code>, and issue the command:<br />

ESRI&#8217;s ArcSDE is a value added database application server on top of relational databases which is efficient in spatially enabling databases and accessing the spatial content in the database.  Combining the use of these two technologies to analyze your spatial data can provide an efficient development model for your spatial applications. </p>
	<p>The example we will look at here today is a web application which queries a spatially enabled database for place names.  The selected place name will be mapped on the web canvas.  The web application model will be a front servlet controller model as specified by the Core J2EE Pattern Catalog.  The presentation tier request mechanism must control and coordinate processing of each user across  multiple requests.  This example will use a servlet which serves as a single entry point for all requests.  An input form collects all the initial input parameters from the user.  By submitting this input form, the controller places the input parameter values in the session so they can be accessed by several pages.  Views are created to display the dynamic content provided by the View Beans.  A master view displays the entire set of a SQL query and a details view displays individual query records.  The View Beans are Java Bean wrappers which do the work or retrieving and displaying SQL and Spatial data.  View Beans allow for more control over how data is displayed when rendered by web pages.  A relational database is accessed transparently in this model by a custom Java Bean to access data through JDBC and ArcObjects.  When we access the SHAPE column of a spatially enabled table through JDBC we use it as a Java Object as follows: </p>
	<p><code>Object ret = getDBSelect().getColumn( SHAPE_LABEL );</code></p>
	<p>Where <code>SHAPE_LABEL</code> represents the name of the spatial column.  This value may vary depending on which database you are using with ArcSDE.  We can convert the object to string to get a long binary translation of our SHAPE column: </p>
	<p><code>massageOutput(ret)</code></p>
	<p><code><br />

      Object out = in;<br />
      //Place code here to format your output<br />
      return (out != null) ? out.toString() : "";<br />
   }<br />
</code></p>
	<p>In order to map our selected query we need to make sense of the SHAPE output.  We can use the Java API to ArcObjects to accomplish this.  We will use the Java API in a local context which allows our J2EE application server to manage the contexts of the spatial objects we create.  ESRI is currently not supporting this approach, but it is a legal use of ArcObjects.  I will have to submit another web log on the tips and tricks for this approach.  We can use the server, database, user and password parameters from our JDBC connection.  We only need to add the service port, default is 5151.  Once we make a connection we can begin using ArcObjects to access the same data, create a feature class from the result, and ultimately return a geometry type for the SHAPE column.  </p>

	<p><em>Server Object Manager (SOM)</em><br />
The Server Object Manager component of ArcGIS Server manages deployment of ArcObjects Containers for the purpose of managing the lifecycle of the objects.  SOM administrators create SOC instances based on service configurations deployed on container machines which support ArcObjects.  This provides a scalable platform for the execution of remote multi-user ArcObjects applications.  </p>
	<p><em>Server Object Containers (SOC)</em><br />
The Server Object Containers are multi-threaded executables configured to support one to four concurrent instances determined by the isolation levels.  High isolation deployments support one instance per SOC executable, low isolation deployments support up to four instances per SOC executable.  </p>
	<p><em>ArcGIS Server Platform Configurations</em><br />
ArcGIS server can be architected into multiple tier configurations.  Single-tier configurations provide all ArcGIS Server components on one platform or hardware machine.  Such configurations can be on multiple platforms to allow for network load balancing.  This configuration is appropriate for development and prototyping or production sites with a limited number of service requests.  A two-tier ArcGIS Server configuration separates the ArcGIS Server components from the data components.  This allows a single copy of the data to support multiple ArcGIS containers.  This configuration is most appropriate for development and prototyping or small production sites.  The three-tiered configuration is the most appropriate production configuration as it separates ArcGIS Server components among two tiers and data.  Couple this into a high availability configuration, or server farm, allows for the highest failover rates and is most appropriate for large production sites.  </p>
	<p>Integrating the ArcGIS Sever platform into a distributed n-tier enterprise system has many challenges.  The main challenge is recognizing the components ArcGIS server provides and where they fit into a distributed n-tier enterprise system.  One way J2EE business tier components can communicate through the integration-tier into a proposed GIS EIS system is with the Java Connector Architecture (JCA).  The JCA proves Java&#8217;s flexibility by integrating  non-java data sources and/or applications.  The business flow to integrate ArcGIS server is as follows: </p>
	<p>1: The Connection Factory interface provides a connection to an EIS instance.<br />
2: A transaction manager coordinates transactions across multiple resource managers.<br />
3: Resource Adapter provides an API through which an application can access a resource outside of J2EE and support for local transactions performed on the underlying EIS.<br />
4: The ESRI Java runtime is our EIS in this architecture.  This is intended to isolate all threading and server socket connections used by the ESRI Java runtime.<br />
5: ArcObjects COM represents the system level EIS.  The ESRI Java runtime is responsible for making connections into the system level EIS.  </p>
	<p>All of these tiers will work together by sharing components and communicating in ways native to each module.  </p>
