<p>Thursday, April 14, 2005</p>

<p>Mom,</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't really know where to start. I guess I should start by explaining why I am writing this letter. Earlier today, I was told that your slowed breathing could be a sign that the end is nearer than we had expected. I don't know what's going to happen; I wish I had a crystal ball and would, though. After speaking to that counselor yesterday, I realized there were a few things that I wanted to tell you. However, I don't think I can say these to you face-to-face, and I was hoping a letter would allow me to express what I feel a bit better.</p>

<p>I am going to miss you terribly, but I want you to know that I will be fine. Pinhead is still doing well and moving around quite a bit, and in a little over a month, he should be here! I know you're worried about us, but it really has helped me to be pregnant now. It helps me to think about him when I feel sad, and it certainly gives me something positive to think about. Mike is also taking very good care of me, and I k now that he will always be by my side. He is a wonderful husband as you have been able to witness, and provides a lot of support. He is also going to be a wonderful father.</p>

<p>I know that you and I had all these plans for the future; I certainly did. I was looking forward to you helping me the first few days after the birth, and I was also looking forward to you living closer to us, and teach little pinhead Dutch &amp; French. He would have loved his grandmother, and would certainly have enjoyed visiting you. But don't worry, he'll get to know you anyway. I have lots of pictures of you, and lots of stories to tell him. I'll tell him about our vacations, how you helped me learning that &quot;auto-dictee&quot; for class, how you made it possible for me to move to America. I'll tell him about our barbecues on the terrace of the apartment, about family gatherings where you and your sisters would start singing when you heard a specific word. I'll tell him about the St. Nicolas tables, and he'll get to experience that one first hand.</p>

<p>You've given me a great childhood and a great start on life. I'm so happy being in America, and having met Mike. I still think about that almost every day. You are a wonderful mother, and always made sure I knew you loved me. I hope that I will be as good a mother to pinhead as you were to me.</p>

<p>While I would have preferred different circumstances, I am trying to look at the positive side of this whole experience. Not many people have had the chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. I know that being able to do that with Boma made a world of difference to me, and being able to do that with you is exponentially more important. It could have happened more suddenly, and I would have always regretted not being to say goodbye.</p>

<p>I love you with all my heart,</p>

<p>Marianneke</p>";}s:2:"dc";a:3:{s:7:"subject";s:8:"Personal";s:7:"creator";s:17:"Marianne Cardwell";s:4:"date";s:25:"2005-05-04T21:04:16-04:00";}s:7:"summary";s:205:"I read once that anything you put on the internet never disappears, so this is my way to make you live on forever.

<ul><li>When using IMapAlgebraOp, it will sometimes bomb out at the Execute command. Not for every Execute command, that would make it too easy. Only some. But it is consistent with those.

It's legal to carry it, but, but - but that doesn't matter 'cause -- get a load of this, allright -- if you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you. I mean that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.<br /><strong>Jules</strong>: Oh, man, I'm goin', that's all there is to it -- I'm fuckin' goin'.<br /><strong>Vincent</strong>: I know baby. You dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?<br /><strong>Jules</strong>: What?<br /><span style="color: #ff3300;"><strong>Vincent</strong>: It's the little differences. I mean they got the same shit over there that they got here, but it's just - it's just there it's a little different.</span><br /><strong>Jules</strong>: Examples?<br /><strong>Vincent</strong>: Allright, well you can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer. And I don't mean just like in no paper cup, I'm talking about a glass of beer. And in Paris, you can buy a beer at McDonald's. And you know what they call a, uh, a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?<br /><strong>Jules</strong>: They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?<br /><strong>Vincent</strong>: Nah, man, they got the metric system, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.<br /><strong>Jules</strong>: What'd they call it?<br /><strong>Vincent</strong>: They call it a &quot;Royale with Cheese.&quot;<br /><strong>Jules</strong>: (repeating) &quot;Royale with Cheese.&quot;<br /><strong>Vincent</strong>: Thats right.<br /><strong>Jules</strong>: What do they call a Big Mac?<br /><strong>Vincent</strong>: Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it &quot;Le Big Mac.&quot;<br /><strong>Jules</strong>: &quot;Le Big Mac.&quot; (laughs) What do they call a Whopper?<br /><strong>Vincent</strong>: I dunno, I didn't go into Burger King.

<p>The funny part is that the ArcIMS &amp; GIS portion of all this ended up taking less time and being easier than the HTML/VBScript/ASP/CSS part of the coding. I'm not that familiar with it, and I find it harder to find good documentation about those languages. I very much like the ArcXML and HTML Viewer documentation that comes with ArcIMS; it's rather good. I got lots of help from a couple of colleagues with the non-ArcIMS specific coding, and their help was just invaluable. It would have taken me much longer without them. There were also times when I was ready to give up on a specific idea, and go another way, but they eventually figured it out. So thanks guys!</p>

<p>So now another colleague is going to test the site out a bit, and see if any improvements are needed. Then he'll demo it to the client, and then, of course, I'll probably have to make changes to it once people really start using it. But I'm assuming that's still a little ways down the road. Probably just long enough for me not to remember how I did everything.</p>

<p>In any case, I got it done, in a relatively short time (I did have other things to work on), and I got all the requested tools programmed.
