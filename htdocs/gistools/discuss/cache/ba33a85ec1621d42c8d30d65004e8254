However, this post may bend that rule.

For those not in the know, a webpage does a lot of behind-the-scene work before it spits-out text on the screen. Here's a summary of what this webpage does:

? The very first thing that webpage does is send out a header depending on the client-browser. This is recommended when, say, different protocols are used to access the webpage. Note that this step gets initiated only after the webserver has finished running through its configuration directives. The webpage then marks the start-time for script download and execution. Measuring script download and execution time helps in diagnostics. The webpage also goes down a list of red-flags checking for browser compatibility and permission-settings. Later, it establishes connections with databases and fetches or defines client and script variables.

? Only then does the layout begin to emerge with some CSS, XHTML and plenty of include files. Care is taken to separate presentation which has been kept to a minimum given the volunteer nature of the website, from content and make it easier to reuse repeat data. To display news feeds, as is the case here, the webpage fetches the feed URL and slices its content into nodes. Sometimes feed URLs do not provide information as desired. For example, this feed URL does not provide a direct hyperlink to its article. Sometimes a feed URL includes an image-path in its description that needs to be dropped. For such cases, scripting languages like PHP offer a wide-array of string-manipulation functions. It is advisable to ensure that the webpage continues to get parsed in a timely manner even if the fetching fails.

? The webpage then wraps-up logging of relevant variables and closes open database connections. If script execution has generated any errors, a summary gets emailed to the administrator. The webpage then spits-out the footer. Its decay into dead text is finally complete [...well, unless you use AJAX to monitor client-behavior, as is the case here].

Unlike for its regular mapping where Google predictably uses GIF image-tiles each sized at 128px*128px, for its satellite imagery, Google's preference for JPEG over another competitive format PNG, is worthy of a second glance: As is common knowledge, JPEG supports millions of colors, but is infamous for its lossy compression. PNG on the other hand, is lossless while supporting millions of colors. However, PNG is currently not supported by all browsers and depending on compression settings, may end-up weighing more.

? 
[10/18/1907] Signalizing the opening of the Marconi Service to the public, and conveying a message of congratulation from Privy Councillor Baron Avebury, formerly Sir John Lubbock
? 
[01/08/1927] Opening new radiophone service; First private call to The New York Times
? 
[10/05/1957] The Naval Research Laboratory announced early today that it had recorded four crossings of the Soviet earth satellite over the United States
? 
[07/21/1969] Astronauts land on plain; Collect rocks; Plant flag

Since the most important technological developments in the time period covered occured in the western world, and since The New York Times can safely be assumed to best mirror these developments, notwithstanding the selective sample included in Page One, I consider these to be our most important technology-related headlines from 1851 to 2002. Although, sometimes technological change can seep in without so much as a loud knock or one bold headline [think Internet]. 

For those wondering about a headline that may seem conspicuous by its absence, say one that heralds the omnipresent automobile, keep in mind the time period covered. It is widely accepted that the automobile, for example, was invented by France's Nicolas Cugnot between 1725-1804.
