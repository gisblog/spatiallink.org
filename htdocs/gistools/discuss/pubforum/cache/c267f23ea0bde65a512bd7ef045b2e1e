In v5.7 it works fine and the output is<br />

<br />
However, in v8.0, the entry for possible_keys is (null).  Why is this the case? I would like to use an index to speed up my query.<br />

Since version 5.7.6 something seems to be changed. When I try to get do a st_intersects() or an intersects() on two geoms, I get an error message, that the spatial data should be in the same SRID.<br />
<br />
Why has this been changed?<br />
<br />
Because sometimes I want to get all data which intersects with a certain bounding box. But the data in my table can have different geometrical data in different srids.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug or is there any reason to cut off this functionality?<br />
