<p >Personally, I use this all the time. As a developer the concepts in the desktop help system are key and in some cases not available in the EDN developer help. The 9.2 release is huge and quite possibly one of the largest releases of new functionality since 8.0.</p>

<p >If i were looking at 9.2 for the first time i'd go straight for the <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=What%27s%20new%20in%20ArcGIS%209%2E2">what's new section</a>. After that i'd hit the new video tutorials such as this one on <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/tutorials/maplex_tutorial_index.htm">maplex</a>.</p>

<p >My only beef with the help system is that its not indexed on google. a search for "geodatabase topology" on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1B2GGGL_enUS177&q=geodatabase+topology">google returns nada</a>; but one on the help system returns <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/search/results.cfm?v=2&q=geodatabase+topology">all sorts of goodness</a>.</p>

</p><p >So why do this? Well, we’re still running daily builds of ArcGIS 9.2 and I need to pick up updates to not only the software but also the developer resources and help systems. Internally we have some tools that allow you to pull the latest build without having to use “add remove programs” to uninstall and then re-install the software. I use this often but I like to go through the painful process of uninstalling everything and then rerunning the installs from scratch once every week or so.

Don’t have the product installed just run the installer and then click on the install program’s help button.

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p >This week I keep thinking about bandwidth
</p><p >First, I spent last week in New Jersey teaching a ArcGIS System Architecture and Design class to some program managers (and a few developers) working with the <a href="http://www.cjmtk.com/">Commerical Joint Mappint Toolkit</a> (CJMTK). A key point that kept coming up was bandwidth and in particular the lack of it. During the workshop we spend a lot of time talking about strategies for  handling data (both static data as well as real time feeds) this evolved into methodologies for handling data transmission with ArcObjects and also how do some basic GIS analysis, both on the client and also on a server.  All of this hits home once you start measuring how much is really being transferred over the network. 
</p><p >I sometimes think of it like a giger counter, one that you can hold up to your application, the network, server and databases. Given a particular scenario where is the lifting happening and how much data is being transferred up and down the stack of software. You can’t start dialing in the performance until you know where things are happening.
</p><p >It is easy to develop applications assuming unlimited bandwidth. Heck, my mouth is already watering just thinking about the rollout of  Verizon’s  <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/content/ConsumerFiOS/">FIOS</a> network in Redlands (think 5-30Mbps) of at home broadband.  It’s too bad we don’t have this for boys on the battlefield.
</p><p ><strong >No WiFi?</strong>
	</p><p >What do you do when there isn’t a network cable or Wi-Fi in the vicinity? For me I whip out my <a href="https://business.cingular.com/cingular/generic/phone_details.jsp?skuId=sku73950382&parentCatId=cat17840066&productId=prod82440260&categoryId=cat17840084">cingular 2125 smartie phone</a> and use its data connection over Bluetooth. The connection is reliable but since I don’t have the fancy EDGE network I’m pinned down to about 130 kbps.  Yes, a little slow but at least there’s plenty of it given my $19.99 unlimited usage plan. This isn’t bad for syncing e-mail and visiting most web pages but it makes me realize what I take for granted. On a connection like this I start turning things off skype, gtalk, msn messenger, shutdown the RSS aggregator, put outlook in off-line mode and then turn things on as I need them.
</p><p >Last week we were working in the basement with not only no internet access but also some pretty crappy cell phone service. I’m used to my cingular data connection to being slow but not intermittent. Using it in the room was useless but using it in the hall with a Bluetooth connection to my laptop about 30-40 feed away was a different story. This worked (I hid the cell in a planter so it wouldn’t be disturbed) and used the network connection but unfortunately,  the bluetooth signal started to deteriorate and thus I was left with an even slower connection. 
</p><p >I did a little experiment with ArcWeb vector and image services over the connection and all worked well. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any ArcGIS Servers that I could test with outside of the firewall.
</p><p ><strong >In catching up with the news: 
</strong></p><p >Tim O’Reilly has an interesting article on the importance of datacenters (<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/07/cloudy_with_a_chance_of_server_1.html"><em >operations: the new secret sauce</em></a>) in an environment where being a developer on someone else’s platform means running your application in their datacenters. This translates to a web platform where hundreds of thousands of servers that need to be located near cheap power and favorable bandwidth deals. I liked Tim’s closing point  in that where operations centers used to be boring they are now the ground zero of today’s computing wars.
</p><p >Yesterday YouTube announced that they just broke the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/17/youtube-serves-100m-videos-each-day/">100 million videos a day barrier</a> and that they host 60% of the videos viewed online.  Holy crap the internet pipe coming out of these guys must be on fire. How do you sustain the cost of this much bandwidth without going out of business? Are the ads really paying the way? I guess this is the web 2.0 social services model of building community and then hoping someone buys them.
</p><p >I guess the <a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html">long tail</a> applies to YouTube as well. See there is something for everyone.

</p>

<p >We did this for a few reasons. Most importantly we wanted to extend the event by a day and logistically the only way we could do this was to move it mid week (post bpc). We also received a lot of feedback from the developers saying that they didn’t want to travel or work over the weekend. I was a little surprised at this but hey, that’s what you told us. 
</p>

<p >Lastly, when we started talking about the flow of both events, and the crossover between BPC and developer summit attendees, it simply made sense.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m running a daily build of the ArcGIS 9.2 and somehow beheaded my desktop help system. I was looking for a cheat sheet on the steps for creating raster catalogs. I did a quick search on the support site and quickly found what I was looking for – I also found a few other how to articles that caught my attention. 
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=28390">Create a geodatabase Raster Catalog</a> Instructions provided describe how to create a raster catalog in a geodatabase. At ArcGIS 9.0 rasters are fully supported in the geodatabase environment, both Personal Geodatabases and Enterprise (ArcSDE) Geodatabases.
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=21327">Select the correct geographic (datum) transformation when projecting between datums</a> It is necessary to specify a geographic (datum) transformation when using the ArcToolBox Project Wizard (ArcGIS version 8.x) or Project Tool (ArcGIS version 9.x) to project shapefiles or geodatabase feature classes between different geographic coordinate systems (datums).
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=23025">Projection Basics FAQ: What the GIS professional needs to know</a> Outlines the fundamental concepts needed to understanding the use of map projections in ArcGIS.
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=15380">Connect to an Excel spreadsheet in ArcCatalog</a> Steps to connect to an Excel spreadsheet from ArcCatalog. ArcCatalog can retrieve data from Microsoft Excel 5.0, 7.0, 97, or 2000 files.
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=22526">Clip a multiband image using ArcGIS and Spatial Analyst</a> Instructions provided explain the procedure to clip or sub-set a multiband image. The Spatial Analyst extension is required.
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=24893">Identify an unknown coordinate system using ArcMap</a> Instructions provided identify the coordinate system for data that do not have coordinate system information, using the project-on-the-fly utility in ArcMap.
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=26892">Repeat-run a geoprocessing tool-batch style processing</a> Users are able to use Model Builder in conjunction with geoprocessing tools to create time saving tools based on complex workflows. However, many users are interested in running these tools or their own tools over and over again, &quot;batch&quot; style. Scripting gives users this functionality in ArcGIS. A variety of scripting languages are supported in the geoprocessing environment of ArcGIS 9.0, including Python, VBScript, JScript, and Perl. In fact any scripting language that is COM compliant can be used to create successful geoprocessing scripts.
</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=24985"><u>Index of&nbsp; technical articles concerning projecting raster data in ArcGIS</u></a>A collection of 6 articles which discuss when, and how to project raster data in ArcGIS.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=30859"><u>Convert coverage annotation to a geodatabase eliminating required fields</u></a> Instructions provided are for the conversion of annotation from an ArcInfo coverage to a personal or SDE database, eliminating all but two 'required' fields for the coverage annotation feature class from the geodatabase feature class in ArcCatalog. The Convert Coverage Annotation tool, a customize tool available in ArcMap is used for this procedure.</p></div>

I just got back on Sunday from a quick week of vacation in <a href="http://www.puntabanda.org/">Punta Banda</a> [<a href="http://spatiallyenabled.blogs.com/downloads/PuntaBanda_beachHouse.kmz">kml</a>] Baja California (just a hair south of Ensenada).&nbsp; If you live around SoCal and are thinking about a quick, cheap, getaway that’ll make you feel like you’re you in one of those corona commercials you should check this place out. It’s a beautiful area with long sandy beaches, warm water and&nbsp; some sweet little beach houses reaching out towards pacific on a giant sand spit. </p>

<p>warning, If you surf don’t go – the beach faces west / north-west and rarely sees much of a swell, especially in the summer. I broke a couple ribs just before we left so for me it wasn’t that big of a deal – a little R&amp;R in my lounge chair with a fresh margarita which was just what the doctor ordered.
</p>

<p>Usually I do a little e-mail while I’m away – this time I was not only physically, but also mentally, far from a wifi hotspot. So what did I come home to? About 550 e-mails.&nbsp; The initial triage was fast – but still underway.
</p>

<p>My strategy? I first sorted on the normal internal spam messages (e-mails with daily build status, source code check-ins,&nbsp; etc) this knocked out about 150. Next I hit the messages where I was the only recipient then categorized messages into folders (and used some flags to set priority). This was pretty quick.
</p>

<p>65 – general 9.2 projects
</p>

<p>20 – 9.2 related web projects
</p>

<p>12 – 2006 user conference
</p>

<p>84 - ArcScripts narc button (complaints about commercial software) 
</p>

<p>8 – customer feedback from the EDN site
</p>

<p>33 – internal technical aliases
</p>

<p>Almost done getting back to everyone but not the best thing to come back to from vacation.

 Last week I was working in the holistic testing lab and one of our visiting beta sites asked me about the<em><a href="http://www.esri.com/technology_trends/index.html"> technology trends in GIS</a></em> feature on the main website.&nbsp; I hadn't seen it before so we checked it out. </p>

<p>Currently&nbsp; the only published trend focuses on cartography and in doing so it does a great job of highlighting some of the cartographic generalization and representation capabilities that are coming out at 9.2. This is a great run down on some of the things that you'll see soon such as:</p>

<ul><li>database solution for storing multiple representations of geometry</li>

<li>some really slick (and intuitive) editing tools for managing representations and generalizations</li>

<li>geoprocessing support</li>

<li>map production tools</li></ul>

<p>I'm hoping that the site will focus on general trends and bigger architectural picture with pointers to reference implementations and other documentation to help with best practices etc.</p>

<p>I also like the use of text, podcast and video to get message across. </p>

<p>Given some of the new areas that GIS is headed with server and moblie solutions this should be a great place to keep your eyes on.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://myesri.blogspot.com/2006/05/dev-summit-slides-now-online.html">Rob</a> and <a href="http://se7en.co.nz/cms/scrappad/archive/2006/05/04/2477.aspx">Jay</a> recently pointed out that a portion of the developer summit proceedings are now available on the EDN site.</p>

<p>We're in the process of uploading the content, right now we're in a funny state considering that we only have a portion of it up. </p>

<p>Before I tell you about the plan you should first know that the content from the developer summit falls into a couple of different categories; first, videos from the individual sessions; and secondly, the slides and in some cases accompanying sample code wrapped up in a zip file.</p>

<p>Our plan is to load the slides and sample code into the <a href="http://edn.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=downloads.gateway">downloads section</a> of the website and the videos into the <a href="http://edn.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=media.gateway">media center</a> under a new category called <em>Developer Summit 2006</em>. Once we get the content loaded we'll add links to the videos and slides from the corresponding session descriptions&nbsp; on the <a href="http://edn.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=devSummit.gateway">developer summit tab</a>. We'll also cross link the videos (in the media center) to the accompanying slides (in the downloads) section. </p>

<p><strong>So where are we?</strong><br />As <a href="http://se7en.co.nz/cms/scrappad/archive/2006/05/04/2477.aspx">Jay</a> and <a href="http://myesri.blogspot.com/2006/05/dev-summit-slides-now-online.html">Rob</a> have already posted we're got the slides up on the downloads section. We're about ready to load the videos but before we do so they need to be re-encoded with some streaming hints for our quicktime server. This should be done shortly. Once this happens it is just a matter of copying up the files and then hooking up the links.<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p></div>

I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2006/04/20/esri-betaweb">spatially adjusted</a> and <a href="http://se7en.co.nz/cms/scrappad/archive/2006/04/22/2462.aspx">scrapped</a> for pointing out the new ArcGIS 9.2 betaWeb&nbsp; </p>

<p>The new site has been a work in progress for the past several months. It pulls together new web infrastructure a new way to organize content via information centers with corresponding blogs, forums, downloads, media and a wiki but most importantly we're working on some new editorial changes to keep the site stocked full of content. </p>

<p>Hmm, that's nice but why didn't you know about it earlier?</p>

<p>I'm seeing a trend in contributing to this site. I get really engaged with work, spend long days in front of my computer but fall short in posting here. So I think to myself, what better opportunity to cover the design aspects of the new betaWeb site than while it was being pulled together? Hmm, so much for the transparency that i've talked about.</p>

<p>whats next?</p>

<p>I had a little messenger chat with james the other day and he gave me some subtle grief that I shouldn't have an excuse for not getting stuff up on this site. after all i'll be done with this post in just a few minutes and how long with it take me to write the next one ~10-15 minutes? Maybe I just woke up from that coma again... after all, I can ramble about this content free stuff - lets see what I can do to give something more valuable.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Wow, what a great conference.</p>

<p>There's going to be plenty of time over the next couple weeks to review the feedback, debrief on the logistics and to check out the sessions. </p>

<p>Right now I really just want to thank everyone for being part of the event. I could go on and on about the incredible teams at ESRI in events, business partner program, marketing, prof. services, Information Services (our websites) and of course development. the fact is ESRI is an incredible organization and a truly amazing place to work. </p>

<p>What really pulled the conference together were the people, and in particular those outside the fold of ESRI. I couldn't have had more fun talking developer with so many different people. Be it the hallway conversations, sessions, community center, at the pool, the bar - anywhere it great seeing everyone excited and in general just having fun. I can't say that we have some type of grass roots movement going on but I can say that this wasn't the BPC event and it definitely wasn't the UC. Between the technical content and the overall atmosphere I'm really happy with how everything went.</p>

<p>All in all I'm really happy with where we've been over the past year with the EDN program, our changes to the developer products and especially where we're headed with 9.2 and the longer term. Who knows maybe we'll see sometype of tipping point for developers in the next year or two. I guess we'll have to wait and see.<br /> </p>

<p>Until then for me the last couple days have been all about the business partner conference and today i'm in Washington DC for the <a href="http://www.cjmtk.com/">CJMTK developers conference</a>. I won't be covering the event (no cellphones, computers, pagers or anything else electronic and recordable). </p>

<p>Until then here's a snapshot of the <a href="http://www.molw.org/blog">Steve</a> and I <a href="http://smogtownkickball.com/downloads/headed_to_the_devsummit.wmv">headed to the dev summit</a> on thursday last week.</p>

<p>cheers</p>

</p>

<p >Coming to the ESRI Developer Summit? Trying to figure out what a Tech Talk is? Here's a cheat sheet.</p>

<p >Tech Talks are short discussion sessions that are held by technical workshop presenters after their sessions are over. Here's the idea. Each technical workshop lasts 75 minutes. Presenters will cover their material and then take a few minutes to answer audience questions at the end of their session. As you all know each presenter has to scurry out of the room to allow the next presenter to start their session. Here's where the Tech Talks come in.</p>

<p >After the session each of the presenters are scheduled to move over to an area of the community center (central gathering place at the conference) that we've cordoned off for Tech Talks. You'll be able to meet and greet the presenters, ask questions, do some networking and chat about whatever you like all on some comfy furniture in a casual environment. </p>

<p >Not only will you have the chance to spend more time with the presenters (and yes they are there for you, and they do like to talk) but it also gives you a vehicle for meeting with presenters that you might not have been able to catch up with because you were busy in a different session.</p>

<p >Here's an example: Say its Saturday 10:15AM and you're trying to decide between the <a href="http://edn.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=devSummit.detail&guid=0A894000-1244-4D86-B91F-7AFD644EEBC0">.NET Server session</a> or the <a href="http://edn.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=devSummit.detail&guid=A20DCD43-0A9B-4F37-A7BD-121A7B8A1691">Best Practices for Developing with ArcGlobe</a>. With the tech talks you'll be able to hit the Server session and then when it's over you can catch up with the Globe team in the tech talk area to get the highlights of their talk and to ask some of those pointed questions that have been nagging you. This is also a good way to simply see who the presenters are so that you can catch up with them later at the conference.</p>

<p >oh ya, don't forget to let us know what you think about the conference... </p></div>

<p>The Developer Summit is almost here. This week we've nailed down the plenary sessions, \ birds of a feather, SIGs, conference catalog, and a ton of staffing assignments.</p>

<p>I'll be your MC for the Friday and Saturday plenary. We've got Scott and a bunch of the development leads presenting the key tenants behind&nbsp; ArcGIS as well as our vision for forward. On Saturday there are some great talks by IBM and Microsoft on next generation web applications and some of the tooling that will allow you to build them today.</p>

<p>The birds-of-a-feather combined with the SIGs will really fill out an already packed schedule. These will be up on the website shortly until then, here's a sneak peek:</p>

<p >We're already fine tuning the summit as a response to the information that we've received from the conference survey. Last week was a major internal milestone for ArcGIS beta 2. Witht that behind us most of the presenters will be busy using this week to fine tuning their presentations and gear up for the summit. If you have time let the conference team know what you think and what you want to hear at the summit. Your opinions really count and all this is your conference so help us make it the best event possible.</p>

The conference is a two day event with each day starting off with a 90 minute keynote to be moderated by yours truly. that's right no long plenary, just lots of great content that you can actually take home and use.</p>

<p >Here are the details:</p>

<p ><strong >Friday March 17</strong><br ></br>Scott Morehouse, ESRI Director of Research and Development, is chief
software architect and visionary for ESRI, responsible for software
development strategy and implementation. In his keynote presentation,
Morehouse will discuss the ArcGIS platform, covering software
architecture; product vision; deployment frameworks; and developer
options for building desktop, server, and mobile GIS applications.</p>

<p ><strong ><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Saturday March 18</span></strong><br ></br><strong >IBM Presents: Business Processes, Service-Oriented Architecture and Governance for the Enterprise -</strong><strong > Martin Nally, IBM</strong><br ></br>Companies are under increasing pressure to implement software support
for new products and business processes more rapidly. They also need to
be able to integrate their systems with external systems either to
integrate with larger supply chains, or because they wish to outsource
non-strategic function to external suppliers. Mergers and acquisitions
also continue to create the need for integration of systems. The
combination of these and other business pressures are fueling a strong
interest in service-oriented architectures (SOA). SOA holds the promise
of reducing the time to implement new business processes by recombining
core function in a flexible, loosely-coupled manner. Because SOA
implementations can be based on open internet standards, they also hold
the promise of more easily supporting business processes that span
locations and organizations. Companies are also bringing the business
value for their IT investments under increasing scrutiny and at the
same time must comply with increasing levels of regulatory
requirements. This is creating a strong focus on the issues of
governance of the processes of software development and resulting
applications. This talk will explore these topics and describe the
solutions that IBM offers customers for the building, deployment and
governance of SOA applications.</p>

<p ><strong >Microsoft Presents: Next Web Now - </strong><strong >Eddie Amos, Microsoft Corp.</strong><br ></br>Rising from the droplets of the bubble that burst in 2000, the next
generation of the Web is coming. Often called Web 2.0. As Web-based
content and services become increasingly indispensable, users are
expecting to interact with your offerings in new ways and in new
locations. Come to learn Microsoft's take on "the web as a service,"
"folksonomies," "the Long Tail" and other Web 2.0 concepts. You'll hear
about Microsoft's roadmap for the Web, and learn the latest about
Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Vista, ASP.NET, Windows Live!,
as well as "Atlas", Microsoft's new AJAX framework, but who know just
where the conversation will go? And of course, the ESRI attendees may
have an opportunity to join in the discussion and get in a few
questions of their own.</p>

<p >PS we're getting close to 600 registered attendees... </p></div>

If you've been to <a href="http://arcscripts.esri.com/">ArcScripts</a> today, <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2006/02/27/help-clean-up-arcscripts/">like James has</a>, you'll probably notice that we added a Narc button to help keep track of scripts that violate our terms of use. </p>

<p>ArcScripts has a long history in helping the community share samples and utilities targeting the ESRI platform. Unfortunately we occasionally find something that doesn't quite agree with the intention of the site. This is usually ends up being a piece of demo software or a trial-version.</p>

<p>I agree that we need to preserve the intention of the site but disagree with Jame's comment that we're trying to <em>&quot;get a handle on the ArcScripts disaster&quot;</em>. The site still serves it's intended purpose and it's far from a disaster.</p>

<p>I will say this, James has helped us take note (&quot;<a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2006/02/02/how-to-increase-your-sales-via-arcscripts/">how to increase your sales</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2005/09/25/better-than-buying-an-ad/">Better than buying an ad</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2005/10/16/more-on-commercial-software-in-esris-arcscripts/">more on commercial software...</a>&quot;) and to his credit has fueled some of the recent work that we're doing in this area.</p>

<p>So I did a little research into ArcScripts and can therefore tell you where we're at. First, ArcScripts has been in business for the past 8 years. If used to write Avenue code you're probably intimately familiar with the site. I also found out that the site has been relatively unchanged since it was first launched and because it straddles a line between the support and edn sites it doesn't really have a proper home. Here's some numbers: ArcScripts currently hosts 3900 scripts; in the past month 30 new scripts have been added; and in the past 5 months almost 400 deleted. </p>

<p><strong>Where are we?</strong><br />I've taken ownership of the site. We're in the process of doing another pass to review the content. we won't go through every script but we will check the obvious areas where this type of stuff might crop up. Given that this is a community site I thought it would be appropriate to ask the community to help keep it in check; hence the narc button. if you hit the button you'll be asked to let us know why you think a particular script should be reviewed. If you like you can include your e-mail when you send us the information and we'll keep you in the loop as we review the content and take action.</p>

<p>Additions to the site will still be pass through (i.e. we won't review each one for approval). We will however check uploads every couple week.</p>

<p><strong>Where are we headed?</strong><br />As we move forward we'll put together a design to tear ArcScripts down and then rebuild it with a more modern design. This shouldn't be that hard and we'll be sure to take pages out of the open source playbook. Our goal will be a site that we can use to share code, data models, geoprocessing scripts, address data models and all kinds of other content. In doing this we'll have to make decisions; do we want source code control? be able to have threaded discussions on scripts? rate content? screen shots?&nbsp; </p>

<p>With the Dev Summit coming up and ArcGIS Beta 2 on the horizon we'll have to let this simmer for a couple of months. In the meantime let me know if you have and requests.</p> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

 <br />Over the weekend Jesse and Sue posted the <a href="http://veryspatial.com/?p=651">Very Spatial</a> podcast interview. I've done some interviews over the phone before but nothing that was ever recorded and distributed as an audio file. All in all it came out pretty good but I think the audio could have been a little better. I'll take the blame for this - the speaker phone in my office is less than optimal. Oh well, I guess we can try something different next time.&nbsp; Regardless, I really appreciate Jesse and Sue's help.</p>

<p>I should also say that its great to see ESRI <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/podcasts/veryspatial.html">sponsoring podcasts </a>like this. You've probably already noticed that ESRI is spending a lot of time working on areas related to RSS, podcasts, blogging as well as other ways to get information to our customers. It isn't just a coincidence that we sponsor programs like this. ESRI is activly embracing changes in the web and in how people communicate, and hold conversations, on-line.</p>

<p>If you haven't noticed yet we've got a few RSS feeds on the main ESRI page as well as on the support site. you'll start seeing more blogs shortly as well as podcasts coming from various teams from around ESRI.</p><br /><br />
