<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We've loaded up <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a> up on our <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/">Linux server</a> to start playing around with it and I'll post some thoughts I have of things so far.<br ></br>
<br ></br>Getting PostgreSQL installed wasn't too much trouble, but PostGIS was a pain.  It has to be compiled before installing.  My database programmer got it working after a couple hours, but after using ArcSDE for so many years it was an eye opener.  I'm sure they will get a compiled version up, but for now we had to do it ourselves.  My next thought was to see if ArcCatalog could connect to it.  We tried an <a href="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/psqlodbc/projdisplay.php">ODBC driver</a> and an <a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/oledb/">OleDb driver</a> but had no luck.  Databases are not my strong point and while we were able to get them to connect to PostgreSQL, we couldn't seem to connect to PostGIS.  There must be something in how PostGIS handles the spatial data that these drivers can't handle.  This is somewhat of a big deal for us as most of our data is in either ArcSDE or Personal Geodatabases and Post GIS only allows loading of data via <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/docs/ch04.html#id3138731">shapefiles</a>. I was hoping to use ArcCatalog to perform the loading, I guess it is export to shapefiles and then use the shp2pgsql command.  It appears that the ArcGIS Data Interoperability Extension supports PostGIS, but if you have to spend over two grand on an extension, what is the point of going to PostGIS.  I'm sure we can script something, but I would have rather had the ArcCatalog option open to everyone.<br ></br>
<br ></br>So what does this mean to our development?  Probably not too much except it is a strike against open source GIS.  If PostGIS had a windows driver that allowed ArcCatalog access, things might be different and we could recommend it to our clients, command line isn't a user friendly proposition.  Open source GIS seems to mimic open source in general.  Its getting better, but you still need command line experience to truly get value from it.  Since ArcGIS 8, ESRI has really pushed the GUI for GIS giving even the most greenhorn GIS specialist commands that 10 years ago where run by very experienced GIS Analysts on UNIX.<br ></br>
<br ></br>It is very easy to criticize ESRI for their products but they have really taken the GUI to places where open source is at least 5 if not 10 years away from being.  I still think that open source GIS has a place on the server side, but we need to figure out ways to get data loaded from industry standard programs such as ArcCatalog before it will start to take off.</div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In my previous post titled, "<a href="http://spatiallyadjusted.blogspot.com/2005/05/esri-arcims-91-is-there-point.html">ESRI ArcIMS 9.1, is there a point?</a>" I asked why didn't ESRI spell out the changes in ArcIMS 9.1. Well I just noticed there is now a <a href="http://downloads.esri.com/support/whitepapers/ims_/arcims_91enhancements.htm">whitepaper outlining the changes and new features</a> of ArcIMS 9.1. This is exactly the information I was looking for, but it was buried in ESRI's support site. If there was ever a reason to have RSS feeds for support, this is it. I'm sure there is much that gets posted in the knowlege base that most users of the support site never see unless they perform a search. I'd love to get feeds of the latest posting of all support site software, Arcscripts and knowlege base/whitepaper articles. That would be killer!<br ></br>
<br ></br>Most of the changes are evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary, but that is fine. I'd prefer stability on the server side and ArcIMS 9.1 seems to do this. There is only one concern I have:<br ></br>
<br ></br>
<blockquote >The ArcXML Guide is provided only in HTML format.</blockquote>
<br ></br>Why do this? Personally I always work off of printed material rather than help or websites for the AXL reference. It doesn't look like there are many changes in the AXL since 9.0, but the future scares me. Moving from printed manuals to PDF was difficult enough, but not even providing a way for us to print them out on our own just hurts. Hopefully ESRI will revisit this and make sure that in the future PDF manuals are an option.<br ></br>
<br ></br>Tomorrow we'll start testing our existing ArcIMS 9.0.x applications with 9.1, but I'm guessing they will work without any modifications.  I'm looking forward to see how it works.</div>

I think I'll upgrade ArcSDE because we don't really do and direct programming with it so I'm sure ArcCatalog can connect fine and I'm sure our existing ArcIMS sites will still work find, but I'm at a loss about what I should do with ArcIMS 9.1.

We don't use ArcIMS on Unix or Linux so its not a big deal that they are at the same level as the Windows support and I don't really see anthing on ESRI's site telling me that there is anything new with the .NET or ActiveX connectors. The WMS Connector is something we've looked at but its nothing we are currently playing with.<br ></br>
<br ></br>Both my ArcIMS installs are working fine so I figure lets just go with ArcIMS 9.0.x and not play with fire. The what's new webpages are nice, but I'd love to see something like a changelog or more detailed writeups of what is new.</div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We've been working on MapObjects application in .NET this past month, trying to see how it would work using some COM objects (previously we've always just used VB6). While it seems to have worked well enough, getting it to deploy has been quite a pain. We just can't seem to get the MO runtime to work well enough with the default Visual Studio installer or even the InstallShield installer. ESRI has been a little help, but we just can't seem to pin down the problem. My programmer came up with a solution using a batch file to run the MO runtime, then install our product. It works, but I'd like to think in 2005 we could get away from using batch files for installation. I came across a .NET open source project called "<a href="http://www.thecarbonproject.com/">The Carbon Project</a>" which seems to be closer to what we want, a pure .NET solution. We've looked at ArcEngine, but until we get our ESRI Developer Network license paid for, we just can't afford to buy it. I had my programmer contact some of the developers on The Carbon Project to see if it could do what we wish. He wrote:<br ></br>
<blockquote >how you can take one polygon, overlay it with another, and get either the area inclusive the two (intersection), the area non-inclusive of the two (clip), the area contained in the first but only that which overlays from the second (identifying), or the total area from both (union).</blockquote>
<br ></br>That is all we really want with this application. Something that us GIS folks have been doing since the beginning of time. MapObjects LT can't do it, but MapObjects 2.3 can. One of the team members of The Carbon Project quickly wrote back:<br ></br>
<blockquote >We have not yet implemented advance geometry manipulations in CarbonTools. I'm sure that there are some source samples on the Web for implementing some of the more common algorithms. If you are up to the challenge and come up with code to resolve some of the issues you described, we would love to share them with our community of users. Hopefully in future versions of CarbonTools we will implement some advanced geometry work (not in the near release of beta 3 however).</blockquote>
<br ></br>Damn, so close. While we'd love to see if we could do it (and we still might) our little application is due early next week. Looks like the batch file install is going to be it.<br ></br>
<br ></br>So what can I learn from this? Well while MapObjects is still a great platform, we've move beyond COM and I think we'll have to leave it in the dust. Not my first choice, but for ease of use, I'd love to keep all .NET code. Also, we'll want to keep on top of The Carbon Project to see if when we have somedown-time, we can possible do what we want. I really wish they had a RSS feed so I know I won't miss anything. When we finally get our ESRI Developer Network subscription, we'll be able to check out ArcEngine and see if it can help us out. I'm just concerned with how the licensing will work with it. We'll just have to wait and see.</div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We've been working on MapObjects application in .NET this past month, trying to see how it would work using some COM objects (previously we've always just used VB6). While it seems to have worked well enough, getting it to deploy has been quite a pain. We just can't seem to get the MO runtime to work well enough with the default Visual Studio installer or even the InstallShield installer. ESRI has been a little help, but we just can't seem to pin down the problem. My programmer came up with a solution using a batch file to run the MO runtime, then install our product. It works, but I'd like to think in 2005 we could get away from using batch files for installation.

If we could eliminate ArcIMS/ArcSDE for these people and still provide our look and feel, this might be a market worth looking into. I'd love to make our sites work with any backend that the client wants. We've used .NET in our latest products, but maybe PHP or JSP would be a better choice for doing this.
