<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Years ago, I got a piece of junk mail inviting me to be in Who's Who.</p>

<p>Apparently, this used to be very exciting news. Pre-web, Who's Who was the best way to tell if someone was connected. You went to the library and looked someone up. You could see (most important) if they were in the book, and then you could see where they went to school, who they married, what they did, what clubs they belonged to...</p>

<p>Wikipedia, of course, changed all that. Wikipedia knows all and tells all, and it doesn't even try to sell you something. Wikipedia is my favorite web destination of all. </p>

<p>Lately, though, the folks at Wikipedia are drawing a line about who's important enough to be inside. A good friend attempted to post her bio and was rejected, &quot;not notable enough.&quot;</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>Are you notable enough? I think so.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that the web is redefining what notable means, and so are we. Famous used to mean Gene Kelly and Mae West, or Sandy Weil and Bill Gates. But with the long tail, notable means: you're the #1 player on your tennis team; you're the top of your marketing department; you're a blogger lots of people read and talk about -- you're the best and most&quot; notable&quot; in your niche, however small.&nbsp; That's the kind of famous that SquidWho is about...<br /> </p>

<p>This being the web and not the real world, we decided to take matters into our own hands and launch <a href="http://www.squidwho.com">SquidWho.</a> The people-powered open who's who online. If you think someone is notable enough to warrant a bio, then they are. Your call, not ours, not some invisible editor's.</p>

<p>If you don't like the bio you see on someone, build a better one. It's free. Royalties go to charity. Best one wins. (Here's a <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/pemachodron/">good one</a>).</p>

<p>The obvious ones (Bono, Mother Theresa and Jaco) are already taken, but that's okay. Build a better one. Not to mention the room for six billion more.</p></div>

<p>It's pretty clear it doesn't work that way. Perfect viral growth, even slow viral growth, rarely happens. If it did, we'd have an elephant problem.</p>

<p>The same thing happens with your idea. If one person told four and the cycle repeated itself for a few generations, everyone would know about it. But they don't. It tails off. One person often tells zero. Or people hear about it but forget.</p>

<p>Real viral growth comes from one of a few likely paths:</p>

<ul><li>Someone sneezes your idea with amplification. They show up on Oprah, or you have $100 million to spend on ads. Great work if you can get it...</li>

<li>The idea spreads with fidelity. One person really does tell four, and there's not a lot of leakage. Starbucks worked this way, largely because the chain grew at just the right rate and kept its character as it did.</li>

<li>The idea is particularly 'viral' (using a popular understanding of the word.) One typical person doesn't tell four, she tells 400. This is the blogger effect--lots of small amplifiers, working in unison.</li>

<li>The idea lives a very long time and spreads slowly. In our rapid-fire world, this one is pretty rare.</li></ul>

<p>It's possible to combine some of these tactics. When a political candidate starts out, for example, it's almost certainly with a grassroots approach, but then, perhaps, once enthusiasm picks up, he or she shows up on TV. You can organize around this and plan for it, but you certainly can't guarantee it.</p>

<p>Here's the big news: it doesn't matter much how many elephants you start with. In other words, big launches don't necessarily scale. What matters is how fertile your elephants are (number of babies per generation) and how long they live. If Darwin's elephants managed to squeeze in just one more generation, they end up with 30 million.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>What's worth more: a pile of gold or a pile of salt? Throughout history, many people have chosen the salt. Gold is pretty, but you can't live without salt, and when it was more scarce than gold, it became valuable enough to use as a currency itself. (The word "salary" is even related to the Latin for "salt.")</p>

<p>Today, of course, salt is close to worthless. Given the choice between a pile of salt and a pile of gold, you'd go for the gold every time, because there's less of it around.</p>

<p>Scarcity, it seems, has a lot to do with value.</p>

<p>...we're running out of a lot of important things--clean water, free time, breathable air, the ozone layer, and honest leadership, just to name a few. At the same time, we have to worry about something that is about to affect just about every business I can think of. We're running out of scarcity.</p>

<p>Scarcity, after all, is the cornerstone of our economy.<em> The best way to make a profit is by trading in something that's scarce. </em>This is why the music and movie industries are so terrified by the millions of people who download entertainment from the Internet every day. Downloading threatens to make supply virtually unlimited, and that could make their offerings about as valuable as those of some kids down my street who recently tried to run a stand selling freshly made mud.</p>

<p>It seems as though once a category becomes successful, the headlong rush to knock it off is stronger (and quicker) than it ever was before. Last week, a woman who came to a seminar in my office was desperately searching for a way to improve her mortgage-brokerage business. I ruined her day when I suggested that she shut her company down and try something else. Twenty years ago, most mortgages were written by the local bank. Those banks planted the seeds of their obsolescence when they eliminated judgment from the writing of mortgages. Once they could automate a mortgage application, so could everyone else. So mortgage brokers used their low overhead and quick wits as an advantage and stole the business. Today, there are an infinite number of brokers to choose from, all offering essentially the same service. The result is that there is no scarcity, and no profit.</p>

<p>It's not just about product knockoffs, of course. While there are almost half a million lawyers practicing in the United States today, there are (gasp!) more than 125,000 in school right now. No matter what you believe about lawyers creating ever more work for ever more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SeL6i3sHM0">lawyers,</a> there's no question that with so many of them, they're hardly scarce.</p>

<p>The same thing is true for doctors, Web sites, T-shirt shops, sushi restaurants, thumbtack manufacturers, and brands of blank CD-ROM disks. There are 100 major brands of bottled water. Someone opened a fancy ice-cream parlor in Manhattan, and then there were six.</p>

<p>If it's remotely digital (like music), then it's easy to mimic. And if it's easy to mimic, someone wins if they can knock off the original--the sooner the better. When someone starts to sell exactly what you sell but for half the price, how long does your good-service, first-mover, nice-person advantage last?</p>

<p>Zara, the fast-growing European clothing store, can knock off a new fashion before the original designer even gets it to the upscale department stores. Suddenly, the original appears to be the copy.</p>

<p>So how do you deal with the shortage of scarcity?</p>

<p>Well, the worst strategy is whining--about copyright laws and fair trade and how hard you've worked to get to where you are. Whining is rarely a successful response to anything. Instead, start by acknowledging that most of the profit from your business is going to disappear soon. Unless you have a significant cost advantage (like Amazon's or Wal-Mart's), someone with nothing to lose is going to be able to offer a similar product for less money.</p>

<p>So what's scarce now? Respect. Honesty. Good judgment. Long-term relationships that lead to trust. None of these things guarantee loyalty in the face of cut-rate competition, though. So to that list I'll add this: an insanely low-cost structure based on outsourcing everything except your company's insight into what your customers really want to buy. If the work is boring, let someone else do it, faster and cheaper than you ever could. If your products are boring, kill them before your competition does.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what's scarce is that kind of courage--which is exactly what you can bring to the market.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>I've spent the last few years fretting about what just happened: <a title="The Columbus Dispatch : Your home as a piggy bank? Not anymore" href="http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2007/08/26/Home_prices_NYT.ART_ART_08-26-07_A1_RO7N85N.html?sid=101">Your home as a piggy bank? Not anymore</a>.</p>

<p>The shared belief about real estate might be in danger. The facts changed this month for the first time. The question that those that market real estate have to answer is this: will people treat a bounce in real estate the way that they think about a drop in the stock market (a chance to profit) or will it lead to a long-term reevaluation of what it means to own a house?</p>

<p>It's interesting to note that insurance on a Ferrari isn't as expensive as you think. That's because fixing a million dollar Ferrari doesn't cost nearly a million dollars. It's the serial number that you're buying--the right to sell that car later for a profit.</p>

<p>If the "serial number profit motive" disappears from residential real estate, what happens? I think it could be bigger (and worse) than most people imagine. If the marketers in the real estate world understand the challenge they face, they may very well be able to market their (our) way out of it. They're out of practice, though.</p><div class="feedflare">

I found myself at Home Depot on Friday. I needed several pieces of wood, cut to size.</p>

<p>When I noticed this sign on the big saw, I took a picture, intending to write about how important it was to have key customer service features up and running. Then, a few minutes later, a guy in an orange smock walked over, took the sign down and asked what he could cut for us.</p>

<p>It turns out (at this Home Depot, anyway), that whenever they don't feel like using the saw, they pretend it's broken. (Yes, technically, they didn't say 'broken,' they said 'not working,' which is sort of true. Except it was the saw operator who wasn't working.)</p>

<p>Sort of like the gas station that won't let you watch them in the garage because of "insurance regulations". It might be a great shortcut, but it can't possibly help in the long run.</p>

<p>PS notice the tag line on the sign. "No one beats our prices, guaranteed..." When was the last time you heard someone complain about the prices at Home Depot? Would you pay 50 cents extra to save half an hour at the checkout? Or a dollar extra to have a trained person help you find something? You can be too thin and you can be too cheap.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>The thing about magical business models is that they are usually unique. A perfect storm, if you want a cliche. DVDs have the following attributes:</p>

<ul><li>We're already used to renting them</li>

<p><li>The renting process is fairly inefficient, sometimes horrible</li></p>

<p><li>We watch DVDs in a group and talk about them</li></p>

<p><li>They don't weigh much</li></p>

<p><li>It only takes 2 hours to watch one</li></p>

<p><li>Many people have an insatiable desire (hundreds a year) for them</li></p>

<p><li>The sellers are an oligopoly and willing to dramatically discount wholesale pricing in exchange for volume</li></p>

<p><li>Investments in process can dramatically lower costs and prevent competition</li></ul></p>

<p>So, while a few passionate people may wish for handbags or jewelry or books or watches to be available this way, none of them are even close to matching the dynamic of Netflix.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean the entrepreneurs shouldn't try. They should. A new business model offers way more room for a new company than an existing one. What it does mean is that they should accept the limited upside of their riff on the model and set their expectations and scale so that they thrive when they're tiny, as opposed to waiting for a miracle to happen.</p></div>

<p>Why do you have to honor a money back guarantee with a former customer who is never going to buy from you again (and it's six years later)?</p>

<p>Why do you have to reinvest and retrain an existing employee who needs some guidance when it would just be quicker and easier to hire someone new?</p>

<p>I think the reason is the same in all three cases. It's not because the thing you do at the end of your swing matters. It's because it's a slippery slope.</p>

<p>If you know that the last two inches of your follow through don't matter, then you'll start slowing down at three inches, or even four, and suddenly it does matter. If you draw the line on money back guarantees you'll keep sliding backwards, bit by bit, until it does matter. If you're quick to fire the employee who needs a lot of help, you'll be quicker with those that need just a little, and then, pretty soon, it's a very different place to work, isn't it?</p>

<p>Obsessing about the last inch of follow through ensures that the important parts of what you do get just as much (if not more) commitment.</p><div class="feedflare">

Eugene Kates died yesterday. I knew him for more than thirty years, and he was a giant.</p>

<p>Eugene helped invent the idea of summer camp in North America. He stood up to the government, to rangers, to staff and even to his customers, the parents. He had a clear view of the way he wanted the world to be, and he stuck with it, regardless of what the world thought.</p>

<p>In an age of 'the customer is king', Eugene was an anachronism. He never said things to make people happy, didn't sugar coat his point of view and he didn't compromise. <br>He once made my parents sit on a mosquito-infested dock for an hour because they had the temerity to come visit without buying lunch at his hotel. And he fired employees (any employee) who put their own needs before safety or the environment. There was one way, and it was his way.</p>

<p>In an age where few people stand for anything, Eugene stood for something. He wasn't afraid to tell you what he thought, and it didn't take long to guess what he expected. </p>

<p>I often encourage you to be like this person or be like that person. I'm not sure anyone could be like Eugene, or even want to be. It's a hard road to be that authentic, that driven, that certain. For fifty years, he made things happen. He didn't sell every slot, didn't make every possible fan, but he made things happen.</p>

<p>For a lot of people, it was easy not to like him. For everyone, it was impossible not to respect him. </p>

<p>I miss him already.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>I immediately tracked down the dastardly organization that had stolen my name and offered them $600 for it. (I would never have paid $100 for this name before it was 'mine.') They turned me down. Not because they were doing anything with it (they weren't, at least not yet) but because they had, in a few short days, grown accustomed to owning it, to dreaming about it, and my guess is that they wouldn't have let it go for thousands of dollars, even though they, like me, would not have paid $100 for it at first.</p>

 Business cards are almost quaint. After all, I can get your info into my computer a lot quicker if you'll just email it to me.</p>

<p>Precisely because they are an anachronism, they serve a vitally important function. In an era where no one dresses up anymore, they give you a chance to position yourself, to represent who you are and what you do in a three cent piece of paper. And yet... almost all business cards are terrible. They are the leisure suits of the marketing the world, the place where bad design not just lives, but thrives. (Wanna guess which one of these ten cards I don't hate?)</p>

<p>I think the point of your card should not be to demonstrate that you are creative. The point should be to demonstrate that you have good taste.</p>

<p>Here's my checklist of common mistakes (and a few suggestions). It's $30 well spent, I think.</p>

<ul><li><em>Don't print your own cards. </em>Just because Avery and others make those little perforated sheets of paper doesn't mean you should use them.</li>

<li><em>Don't use big type for the address and contact info.</em> The #1 way we can tell if a business card is cheesy is with a glance at the type size. Really.</li>

<li><em>Don't buy those color business cards with your face on them.</em> You're not an ordinary real estate agent, so there's no sense in acting like one.</li>

<li><em>Don't go with metal business cards. </em>It might work for Steve Wozniak, but everyone else wants to bring your cards on an airplane.</li>

<li><em>You might think it's a great idea to do a full color card with a big (lousy) picture on it.</em> It's not.</li>

<li><em>I like rounded edges. </em>But only if you leave plenty of margin. (as below)</li>

<li><em>Margins matter. </em>Anytime your type gets anywhere near the margin, you've blown it.</li></ul>

<p>My favorite sources are <a href="http://www.moo.com">Moo</a> (for non-traditional but totally remarkable cards) and <a href="http://www.overnightprints.com">overnightprints.com</a> for classy cards with rounded edges. (The only card of the eight above that I like is the bottom left).</p><div class="feedflare">
