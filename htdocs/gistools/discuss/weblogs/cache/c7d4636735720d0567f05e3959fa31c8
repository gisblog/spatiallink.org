It's probably worth talking about some of the details of how this works without the GeoPDF geoconflation. I try to think about how things work, so I'll describe things from that perspective. Let's start with the PDF file.<br /><br />A PDF file has provisions to store, among other things, two aspects of an electronic document: document content and document structure. For its paper analog, content would be what's printed on the pages and structure would be the order of the pages. Being electronic (why does "electronic" sound dated? maybe "digital" would be better...), PDF can accommodate more bells and whistles than can be placed in a paper book or letter or map or memorandum or summons or fatwa or proclamation or manifesto or whatever: things like interactive bookmarks, hyperlinks, and metadata. In addition to content and structure, PDF has a provision to store <em>annotations</em>. PDF annotations are analogous to sticky notes: they stick on <em>top</em> of the content at a particular location, but are not part of the content. Although perhaps not as ubiquitous as sticky notes, the PDF analog is much more flexible. PDF provides for a variety of annotations, including geometries like polylines and polygons, stamps, clouds, callouts, measurments, interactive 3D, videos, etc. Annotations are not content. They are, in the internals of the PDF file entirely distinct. Addition, removal, and modification of annotations don't modify the PDF content, just as putting a sticky note on that TPS report doesn't change its contents.

Some annotations, like 3D annotations, have to be placed with Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended. Adobe Reader usually cannot modify a PDF file. That's why they call it Reader, and not Modifier, Manipulator, Monkeyer, Munger, or Acrobat. However, Adobe hides little permission bits inside the PDF file that when flipped enable hidden markup tools in Reader and grant permission to use them. In business speak, this is one ways how Adobe "monetizes" Reader. There are two ways to flip those bits: Adobe Acrobat Pro or LiveCycle. The Acrobat method is intended for small work groups and LiveCycle is intended for enterprise work flows.<br /><br />So, if you want you or someone you love to mark up a PDF file in Adobe Reader, you'll need to have that file enabled for comments by Adobe software.

Current Publisher and Composer products GeoMark enable by default, but that's only enough to grant TerraGo permssions -- Adobe permissions are required, too. TerraGo Composer can GeoMark enable other geospatial PDF files, such as those created by ESRI ArcMap, Bentley Microstation, and Safe FME.<br /><br />One thing that's important to note is that this has nothing whatsoever to do with formats, encodings, and openness of standards. TerraGo GeoPDF files are just as open and standards conformant as any other. Just as whether you can markup a PDF file in Reader has nothing to do with the openness of ISO 32000, whether you can access functionality in Toolbar has nothing to do with the openness of the OGC best practice or Adobe's proposed geospatial extensions.

High time for a new post!<br /><br />We recently got an email from a customer who, let's say, had some justified questions about our marketing message and how he perceived our products to behave with respect to GeoMarks and markup. The Toolbar provides a set of tools for placing geospatial markups, or GeoMarks, on GeoPDF files. If you have the Toolbar installed in Adobe Acrobat of any flavor, you can markup GeoPDF and other geospatial PDF files such as those created by ArcMap or Microstation that have been GeoMark enabled. GeoMark enabling is essentially permission from TerraGo to use the markup tools in Toolbar. However, TerraGo's is not the only permission needed to mark things up using free tools: there is also Adobe's when using Reader. If a GeoPDF file is to be marked up in Reader with Toolbar, the file must be GeoMark enabled by TerraGo software and enabled for commenting by Adobe software.<br /><br />GeoMark enabling can happen two ways. First, any GeoPDF file created by recent versions of TerraGo software are automatically GeoMark enabled. Easy enough. Second, TerraGo Composer has the capability to GeoMark enable any supported geospatial PDF file. As mentioned, GeoMark enabled geospatial PDF file can be marked up by the Toolbar in any flavor of Acrobat capable of hosting it. Using Acrobat has many, many advantages over plain Reader because Adobe's comment enabling restricts a variety of modifications and access to the PDF file that could be useful in different workflows. If Reader is required, then PDF files must be comment enabled by Acrobat software. The requirement is not unique to TerraGo's markups -- Adobe's markup tools share similar restrictions.<br /><br />Adobe's comment enabling can happen in a couple of ways. The first is PDF file can be brought into Adobe Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended. There are two ways to get to the goods:<pre><br />Commenting->Enable for Commenting and Analysis in Adobe Reader...<br /><br />Advanced->Extend Features in Adobe Reader...<br /></pre> The other way to enable commenting in Reader is to use Adobe's LiveCycle server.<br /><br />There are a variety of licensing issues surrounding comment enabling with Acrobat, so I kindly refer you to your friendly neighborhood Adobe account manager to explain the intricacies of their licensing policies.<br /><br />To summarize:<br />* to markup any PDF file, use Acrobat<br />* to markup a PDF file in Reader, it must be comment enabled by Adobe software<br />* to apply GeoMarks to a geospatial PDF file, use Composer<br />* to apply GeoMarks to a geospatial PDF file with Toolbar, the file must be GeoMark enabled by TerraGo software<br />* to apply GeoMarks to a geospatial PDF file with Toolbar in Reader, the PDF file must be both GeoMark enabled and comment enabled<br /><br />Hope this helps!";s:4:"link";s:76:"http://geopdf.blogspot.com/2010/04/geomarks-and-marking-up-geopdf-files.html";s:6:"author";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (George Demmy)";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:2:"10";}s:7:"summary";s:2855:"Hrrmm... it's been a while, I see.

There are two ways to get to the goods:<pre><br />Commenting->Enable for Commenting and Analysis in Adobe Reader...<br /><br />Advanced->Extend Features in Adobe Reader...<br /></pre> The other way to enable commenting in Reader is to use Adobe's LiveCycle server.<br /><br />There are a variety of licensing issues surrounding comment enabling with Acrobat, so I kindly refer you to your friendly neighborhood Adobe account manager to explain the intricacies of their licensing policies.<br /><br />To summarize:<br />* to markup any PDF file, use Acrobat<br />* to markup a PDF file in Reader, it must be comment enabled by Adobe software<br />* to apply GeoMarks to a geospatial PDF file, use Composer<br />* to apply GeoMarks to a geospatial PDF file with Toolbar, the file must be GeoMark enabled by TerraGo software<br />* to apply GeoMarks to a geospatial PDF file with Toolbar in Reader, the PDF file must be both GeoMark enabled and comment enabled<br /><br />Hope this helps!";}i:11;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11237729.post-4485081668995291221";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 13:09:00 +0000";s:4:"atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-11-19T08:12:11.181-05:00";}s:5:"title";s:37:"TerraGo Desktop 5.0.2 Patch Available";s:11:"description";s:227:"A bug fix release of TerraGo Desktop -- the free plug-in to Adobe Reader and Acrobat for working with GeoPDF files -- is available at <a href="http://www.terragotech.com/download/download?p=geopdftoolbar">the download page</a>.";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://geopdf.blogspot.com/2009/11/terrago-desktop-502-patch-available.html";s:6:"author";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (George Demmy)";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"1";}s:7:"summary";s:227:"A bug fix release of TerraGo Desktop -- the free plug-in to Adobe Reader and Acrobat for working with GeoPDF files -- is available at <a href="http://www.terragotech.com/download/download?p=geopdftoolbar">the download page</a>.";}i:12;a:9:{s:4:"guid";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11237729.post-8534489729586492630";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Fri, 02 Oct 2009 13:34:00 +0000";s:4:"atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";s:29:"2009-10-02T09:45:38.655-04:00";}s:5:"title";s:43:"US Army Geospatial Center is a MAX Finalist";s:11:"description";s:922:"The <a href="http://www.agc.army.mil/">US Army Geospatial Center</a> is a <a href="http://max.adobe.com">2009 Adobe MAX</a> <a href="http://max.adobe.com/awards/finalists">Finalist</a> in the <a href="http://max.adobe.com/awards/finalists/#public">Public Sector category</a>.

Using PDF files for engineering applications was the brainchild of Phil Lee, one of the founders of <a href="http://www.terragotech.com">TerraGo</a>. In 1999, Phil, then vice president of <a href="http://laytongraphics.com">Layton Graphics</a>, bid on a project to deliver maps and engineering drawings to telecommunications maintenance crews. The maps and drawings came from scanned paper maps, AutoCAD and Microstation design files and backed by different database systems maintained by different engineering groups. Phil was an avid Acrobat user -- fanatic may not be too strong a word. He knew more about getting stuff done with Acrobat than anyone I knew then or since. Taking all of these heterogeneous formats and data to PDF and exploiting the features of PDF and Acrobat was obvious to him. The PDF solution was compelling because it was not tied to any CAD or database system, secure, and easy-to-use. The solution was to render all of the engineering data to PDF, add bookmarks and hyperlinks to ease navigation, and organize the resulting map book with an interactive index map. My nominal role in all of this was for the rendering AutoCAD DWG files to PDF, along with extraction and analysis of the data that they contained for creating links and metadata. Alan Stewart headed up the Microstation side of things. Alan had been writing software to manipulate and render DGN files for quite a while. He arrived at Layton Graphics with Michael Bufkin some years before in an acquisition of Michael's company Cad Share. Michael ran Layton Graphics' engineering group. Michael, Alan, and I are all still working together at <a href="http://www.terragotech.com">TerraGo</a>.<br /><br />The PDF map book project was a big success for Layton Graphics. We delivered the first map book set in the fall of 2000 and last in 2005. We built a custom system that consumed the raw design files and databases and churned out 2500 map book updates quarterly, burned them to CD and delivered them to the different maintenance groups. These map books were popular with the crews, and soon received requests for new features. These features were usually exposed by creating plugins to Acrobat. This was the responsibility of JB Freels. It was increasingly obvious that a combination of software and carefully prepared data was a compelling application that could be used in numerous contexts.

Patrick Graves was brought on board in 2002 to serve as chief software architect and run the software development group. One of the LGIView features was a coordinate finder. Engineering design coordinate systems are almost invariably Cartesian, but they are sometimes aligned with some mapping coordinate system like UTM or a State Plane system. Since the working coordinates were Cartesian, it was a simple matter to embed a rotation, scale, and translation that mapped the engineering coordinate system to that of the PDF.
