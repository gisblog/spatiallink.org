<br />
I am not actually conducting any sort of social experiment and I hate meetings with a passion, but this week I have ended up in two random meetings because someone at Apple dumbed iCal down too far.&nbsp; I am all for simple apps that eliminate all the tedious details, but consider my case.<br />
<br />
I travel.&nbsp; I travel a lot.&nbsp; I switch my laptop's timezone to whatever timezone I am in, because I need my body to feel it is in the right timezone and I need to show up at the conferences and flights at the right time.&nbsp; So when I am sitting in Washington D.C. and I get an email asking me to attend a meeting Thursday next week at 1pm, I click on Thursday, 1pm on my iCal calendar, and after my morning run that gets synched up to my Nano.&nbsp; Then I fly back to California, switch my timezone back, continue my morning runs and synch up every morning to upload my iPod+Nike run data...<br />
<br />
Wednesday night I check iCal my meetings for the next day.&nbsp; Thursday morning after my run I doublecheck the meeting location on my Nano.&nbsp; Thursday, 10am, blah blah and head to the office.&nbsp; Meeting starts and there really isn't anything for me to add.&nbsp; It is interesting enough, but why the heck am I there?&nbsp; Then I think back to Wednesday where I ended up in a meeting and then got a reminder email for a meeting in the same room 3 hours later which puzzled me at the time since that wasn't on my calendar.&nbsp; I figured at the time I was lucky they sent out a reminder.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Anyway, iCal desperately needs some concept of a home timezone, or it should be smart enough to figure it out from the amount of time I spend in one particular timezone.&nbsp; When I am not in my home timezone and schedule a meeting, it should ask me to verify which timezone I mean when I am clicking on the calendar.&nbsp; If you go to the advanced preferences in iCal there is a "Turn on timezone support" thing and when you switch timezones it then nags you about switching ical's main view.&nbsp; I find that annoying and it shouldn't be an advanced option to keep track of timezones.&nbsp; And because of all this bloody integration where everything talks to everything else, my Nano inherited the switched timezone so the calendar in that showed me the same skewed view.<br />
<br />
The interesting part was that I didn't realize until a day later that the extra random meeting I went to on Wednesday wasn't one I was invited to.&nbsp; They had plenty of relevant questions for me in that meeting.<br />
