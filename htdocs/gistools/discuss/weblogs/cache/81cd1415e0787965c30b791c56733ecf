<h2>Workshop Description and Scope</h2>
<p>In their first joint collaboration, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have established the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group. The group aims at investigating and providing guidance for the following challenges (1) how can spatial information best be integrated with other data on the Web; (2) how can machines and people discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same place or feature, especially when this place is expressed or represented in different ways and at different levels of granularity; (3) and what are existing methods and tools to publish, discover, reuse, and meaningfully integrate spatial data. The group is presently surveying the landscape of existing theories, methods, tools, and standards and is creating a set of best practices for their use.</p>
<p>The GIScience community has a long standing interest and expertise in many of the issues outlined above. In fact, work on geospatial semantics, geographic information retrieval, data integration, and spatial data infrastructures, has been part of the GIScience research agenda for many years. Therefore, this workshop aims at bringing researchers together to (1) discuss typical challenges in publishing spatial data on the Web,</p>
<p>(2) identify best practices,</p>
<p>(3) point out conceptual and theoretical foundations that need to be strengthened or established,</p>
<p>(4) identify common quality issues for existing data and lessons learned,</p>
<p>(5) improve and develop existing geo-ontologies for the semantic annotation of spatial data, and</p>
<p>(6) discuss interface and services that will further improve data linking, sharing, and retrieval across communities.<br />
Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic Enablement of Spatial Data Infrastructures</li>
<li>Quality issues in geo-ontologies and Linked Spatiotemporal Data</li>
<li>Experience reports on scalability, discoverability, and so forth</li>
<li>Coreference resolution and data linkage</li>
<li>New perspectives on semantic interoperability</li>
<li>Publishing, retrieving, and accessing sensor data</li>
<li>Modeling measurement types</li>
<li>Ontologies for space and time</li>
<li>Event conceptualization and representation</li>
<li>Long term preservation of spatial data</li>
<li>Provenance and the publication of scientific workflows</li>
<li>Trust and information credibility frameworks</li>
<li>Coverages as Linked Data</li>
<li>GeoSPARQL in the wild</li>
<li>Geo-Data in JSON-LD</li>
<li>Geo-data specific user interfaces for Linked Data and beyond</li>
<li>RESTful services and Linked Data services</li>
<li>Use Cases and Requirements for spatial data on the Web</li>
<li>Best practice for publishing spatial data on the Web</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workshop Format</h2>
<p>The workshop will focus on intensive discussions and experience reports to identify common challenges and best practice for publishing spatial data on the Web. The workshop will accept two kinds of contributions, full research papers (6-8 pages) presenting new work, surveys, and major findings in the areas indicated above, as well as statements of interest (2-4 pages). While full papers will be selected based on the review results adhering to classical scientific quality criteria, the statements of interest should raise questions, present visions, and point to existing gaps. However, statements of interest will also be reviewed to ensure quality and clarity of the presented ideas. The presentation time per speaker will be restricted to 10 minutes for statements of interest and 15 minutes for full papers. This ensures that there is enough time for discussions, interactions, and breakout group leading to a typical workshop setting instead of a mini-conference. Papers should be formatted according to the Latex or Doc LNCS template.</p>

<p>As is the trend in almost all forms of online journalism and blogging (not much difference these days you may say..) I present to you a list of my favourite aviation films for you to watch on Netflix, Amazon , NowTV etc..</p>
<p>So in no particular order ,</p>
<h2>Top Gun (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">1986</a>)</h2>
<p>Of course, Top Gun had a significant impact on me as student, resulting in me wandering around college in a flying suit with genuine US Navy VF-84 crew patches &#8211; I was always keen on authentic details.<br />
A best selling 80&#8217;s soundtrack, Tony Scotts high energy direction, US Naval aviation at its peak and Meg Ryan &#8211; how could you not like this..<br />
Completely missed the the homoerotic subtext at the time !</p>
<h2>The Battle of Britain (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064072/?ref_=ttspec_spec_tt">1969</a>)</h2>
<p>Edward Fox parachuting from his burning Spitfire into a greenhouse and been offered a cigarette by schoolboy, &#8220;Thanks awfully, old chap!&#8221; he responds, there is the perfect encapsulation of the Battle of Britain to the British psyche. Guy Hamilton&#8217;s film needs to be seen in the full 70mm Panavision version to really appreciate the aerial sequences of (mostly) actual Spitfire and Hurricanes dogfighting with admittedly Spanish built  Messerschmitts and Heinkels. Contrast these wonderful scenes with ludicrous dogfights of Pearl Harbour or Red Tails,  why has nobody managed to do a realistic dogfight using CGI ?</p>
<h2>The Dambusters (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046889/">1955</a>)</h2>
<p>Another film deeply ingrained in the British consciousness, this famous film tells the story of  Operation Chastise the bombing of German Dams in 1943. The film to be honest is not great from the perspective of wonderful aerial sequences instead it masterfully illustrates the development of mines by Barnes Wallis and the sacrifice of war experienced by crews of 617 Squadron.  Despite it&#8217;s position in popular culture this is quite a serious film that examines the effect of conflict on the people involved especially Barnes Wallace played perfectly by  Michael Redgrave.</p>
<h2>Hells Angels (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020960/">1930</a>)</h2>
<p>Howard Hughes epic of 1930 so of course rather dated to modern eyes full of melodrama and over acting but the aerial sequences filmed  using real WW1 surplus aircraft and pilots are extraordinary.  The scale of these sequences are amazing, 80+ aircraft in the air flying around the camera aircraft, just imagine the results using modern GoPros !</p>
<h2>Strategic Air Command (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048667/">1955</a>)</h2>
<p>The early years of the Cold War when the American Defence Budget seemed to have no limit, and Propaganda was produced at a similar scale.  Jimmy Stewart, a genuine 8th Air Force Bomber Pilot, does his bit playing a baseball player recalled to serve in the Air Force.<br />
The storyline is nothing to write home about, and the contrast with &#8220;The Dambusters&#8221; released the same year is notable, but the real stars are 1950&#8217;s B-36 and B-47 Bombers.</p>
<h2>The Bridges at Toko-Ri (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046806/">1954</a>)</h2>
<p>The Korean War has not featured very much in cinema and this 1950&#8217;s version of Top Gun stands out because of this and because it&#8217;s actually quite a cool and serious film.. The film builds slowly and despite some light relief from Helicopter Pilot Mikey Rooney, it develops into grim war drama with an unusual ending !</p>
<h2>Always (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096794">1989</a>)</h2>
<p>The polar opposite  of  &#8220;The Bridges of Toko-Ri&#8221;, this is a romantic Steven Spielberg movie with WWII firebombers! A pilot is killed on a firefighting mission and his ghost then has the task of getting his girlfriend together with a younger fire bomber pilot&#8230;.<br />
Well thank heavens for the glorious old and battered A-26, Catalina, C-119 and Bellancas .<br />
A remake of the 1943 &#8220;A Guy Named Joe&#8221;, this should not work, but I have a soft spot for Holly Hunter and warbirds&#8230; so there you go!</p>
<h2>Missing in Action ?</h2>
<p>The film I would not watch might surprise you; 633 Squadron,  great music &#8211; terrible everything else, the use of Airfix models on wires is unforgivable !</p>
<p>Fellow aviation enthusiasts.. what have I missed ?</p>

<h2>Strategic Air Command (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048667/">1955</a>)</h2>
<p>The early years of the Cold War when the American Defence Budget seemed to have no limit, and Propaganda was produced at a similar scale.  Jimmy Stewart, a genuine 8th Air Force Bomber Pilot, does his bit playing a baseball player recalled to serve in the Air Force.<br />
The storyline is nothing to write home about, and the contrast with &#8220;The Dambusters&#8221; released the same year is notable, but the real stars are 1950&#8217;s B-36 and B-47 Bombers.</p>
<h2>The Bridges at Toko-Ri (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046806/">1954</a>)</h2>
<p>The Korean War has not featured very much in cinema and this 1950&#8217;s version of Top Gun stands out because of this and because it&#8217;s actually quite a cool and serious film.. The film builds slowly and despite some light relief from Helicopter Pilot Mikey Rooney, it develops into grim war drama with an unusual ending !</p>
<h2>Always (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096794">1989</a>)</h2>
<p>The polar opposite  of  &#8220;The Bridges of Toko-Ri&#8221;, this is a romantic Steven Spielberg movie with WWII firebombers! A pilot is killed on a firefighting mission and his ghost then has the task of getting his girlfriend together with a younger fire bomber pilot&#8230;.<br />
Well thank heavens for the glorious old and battered A-26, Catalina, C-119 and Bellancas .<br />
A remake of the 1943 &#8220;A Guy Named Joe&#8221;, this should not work, but I have a soft spot for Holly Hunter and warbirds&#8230; so there you go!</p>
<h2>Missing in Action ?</h2>
<p>The film I would not watch might surprise you; 633 Squadron,  great music &#8211; terrible everything else, the use of Airfix models on wires is unforgivable !</p>
<p>Fellow aviation enthusiasts.. what have I missed ?</p>

<div>Hello,</div>
<div>Compliment, Am Chnatal Waldvogel, I work with a pharmaceutical company here in Canada and I got your contact from Indo Canada Chamber of Commerce in Canada and I decided to contact you directly for an investment with my company if you can understand English, Bahasa.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Our company is into production of Pharmaceutical products and Animal Vaccines. There are some agricultural seeds that my company needs from Indonesia for the production of our Animal Vaccines and Anti-viral drugs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We have been purchasing the materials from Pakistan and Sri Lanka but it is very scarce now and we got information that it also exist in Indonesia but we are having problem with the owner of the products due to language barrier.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Please take a moment out of your very busy schedule to respond back to me at my private e mail address for more detail.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Waldvogel</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p>It would make a great film script don&#8217;t you think,  seed smuggling in Indonesia, featuring speed boats, helicopters.. a femme fatale..</p>
<p>Oh well, back to work !</p>

<p>Maps are more widely used because they are fundamentally more accessible, available to us on the mobile devices that are so important to our daily lives, and the maps themselves, manifestations of massive databases of geographic knowledge, are increasingly useful to us at a personal level, they can answer (in some cases literally) questions such as &#8220;Show me how to get home by Bike&#8221;.</p>
<p>These Maps or the now many other ways geospatial knowledge is communicated are the products of teams of software engineers, user interface designers, product managers and visionaries most of whom have a limited knowledge of cartography, just take a look at my good friend Ken&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://cartonerd.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cartonerd</a> blog to see the results good and bad !</p>
<p>But there is an important role for cartographers, to help design future maps or services based on their knowledge of design and the intricacies of geographical information, have we as a industry forgotten or perhaps we never understood the axiom that in cartography &#8220;Less is more&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course I use many examples from Google to illustrate how much the approach to mapping has changed online in just the last decade, so I was accused of pedalling &#8220;Google Propaganda&#8221; ! OK maybe so, but there is a bigger picture here of course and other venders could provide similar examples..</p>
<p>There has never been a more exciting time to be involved in map making, perhaps the art and science of cartography needs to reset it&#8217;s scope now the media of communication is the screen rather than the page, but the potential surely is huge !</p>
