<h2><a href="http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/imagery-at-uc" target="_blank">Imagery @ UC</a> Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>July 18 – 3D Forum &amp; Imagery Social, 4:30-6:30 p.m., <a href="http://events.esri.com/info/index.cfm?fuseaction=seminarRegForm&amp;shownumber=19491" target="_blank">RSVP</a></li>
<li>July 21 – Imagery @ UC &#8211; Making the World’s Imagery Useful, 8:30-11:30 a.m.</li>
<li>July 21-23 – Imagery Island, Exhibit Hall C</li>
<li>July 21 – Imagery Moderated Paper Sessions, 1:30 p.m. – 2:45 p.m.</li>
<li>July 22 – UAS/Drone special interest group, 12:00 p.m. – 1:00 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>While at the Esri UC, I hope you stop by the Imagery Island on the showcase floor.  We have a rocking team of experts assembled this year and over 11 different, really cool demos they&#8217;d like to share with you.  (impervious surface, land use, avalanche analysis, scientific data, contouring, using imagery over the web, pixel filtering, etc.)  Whether you are a beginner, or have your degree in remote sensing, we have people at this island who can show you how using the ArcGIS imagery technology will move your projects from concepts to completion.</p>
<p>See you at Esri UC&#8230;or on GeoNet!</p>

<p>The Maritime Chart Server is an ArcGIS for Server Object Extension that displays vector nautical charts as a query-able GeoServices REST services or OGC Web Map Services.  The Maritime Chart Server supports dynamic querying on the rich data contained within ENCs in order to assist with planning and maritime domain awareness operations.  With Maritime Chart Server, users can publish services that display S-57 products such as AML, ENC, and IENC based on their respective S-52 presentation library implementations.  The services can be accessed through either an on-premise or public website.  Since the data can be queried, applications can be built that allow for analytical capabilities such as search, location calculation, performing measurements of distance and area, and feature identification and attribute display.  In addition, the technology includes S-63 decryption capabilities to produce and serve read-only caches of encrypted ENC datasets.</p>

<span id="more-39491"></span></p>
<h3>Light and Dark popup themes</h3>
<p>
        Use and customize two new looks for the popup by adding either a <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code> class to the popup&#8217;s domNode. Refer to the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jssamples/popup_chart.html" target="_blank">Popup with a chart</a> sample to see the dark theme with simple customizations.
      </p>
<p>      <img src="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/files/2014/07/popup-light-dark.png"></p>
<h3>Use related fields in a popup template</h3>
<p>
        <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/popuptemplate-amd.html" target="_blank">Popup templates</a> support using fields from tables or layers that are part of a <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r3000000zr000000" target="_blank">relationship</a>. The new syntax is discussed in the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/intro_popuptemplate.html" target="_blank">Format popup content topic</a> and we&#8217;ve added a new sample demonstrating how to <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jssamples/popup_relatedrecords.html" target="_blank">use related fields in a popup template</a>.
      </p>
<h3>Integrated OAuth support</h3>
<p>
        OAuth functionality previously available from a sample module is now included in the API. OAuth support improvements includes:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Use localStorage to store tokens when &#8220;Keep me signed in&#8221; is checked.
<li>Prompt user to sign in again when token expires.
<li>Advanced configuration <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/oauthinfo-amd.html" target="_blank">options</a>.
      </ul>
<h3>Measurement widget enhancements</h3>
<p>
        The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/measurement-amd.html" target="_blank">measurement widget</a> now exposes a <code>measure</code> method that takes a geometry to measure. The widget&#8217;s UI was also modified to better show cursor position in geographic coordinates, uses a new pin icon and the location tool no longer deactivates itself after clicking the map. The area, distance and location icons were also updated.
      </p>
<p>      <img src="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/files/2014/07/measurement-enhancements.png"></p>
<h3>Attribute inspector supports editing the time component of date fields</h3>
<p>
        When using the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/attributeinspector-amd.html" target="_blank">attribute inspector</a> with a layer with a date field, both date and time are editable.
      </p>
<p>      <img src="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/files/2014/07/attribute-inspector-date-time.png"></p>
<h3>Label layer changes</h3>
<p>
        The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/labellayer-amd.html" target="_blank">label layer</a> is no longer in beta and this release includes several changes:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Static placement of labels:  in previous versions of the label layer, labels were repositioned on every map navigation event (pan or zoom). At 3.10 the default is to label features when a feature is visible and not continuously reposition labels. The pre-3.10 behavior of continuously re-labeling is available by specifying <code>mode: "dynamic"</code> when creating a label layer.<br />
        <br />
        <img src="//developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/images/label-layer-static-dynamic.gif"><br />
        </p>
<li>Only feature layers can be labeled.
<li>Labeling expressions no longer use <code>${field}</code> syntax but now use <code>{field}</code>. In other words, popup template syntax instead of info template syntax.
      </ul>
<h3>Additional Changes and Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li>New <code>setInfoTemplates</code> method on <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/arcgistiledmapservicelayer-amd.html" target="_blank">tiled</a> and <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/arcgisdynamicmapservicelayer-amd.html" target="_blank">dynamic</a> map service layers to specify an info template for each sublayer of a service. The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jssamples/map_twodynamic.html" target="_blank">Add two dynamic maps sample</a> has been updated to show how to use this method.
<li>New map method <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/map-amd.html#setinfowindowonclick" target="_blank">setInfoWindowOnClick</a> to toggle the default behavior of showing the map&#8217;s infoWindow when clicking a graphic.
<li>New Identity Manager methods including destroyCredentials() and checkSignInStatus().
<li>The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/graphic-amd.html#getlayer" target="_blank">getLayer</a> method on graphics and results from query operations always returns a reference to the associated layer.
<li>Class breaks renderer&#8217;s isMaxInclusive property is always true when creating a renderer. This change was made so that class breaks renderers in the JS API follow how class breaks renderers work in the ArcGIS Server REST API.
<li>Better handling of transparency defined via a symbol or renderer when printing graphics and feature layers.
<li><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/esri.arcgis.utils-amd.html#createmap" target="_blank">esri/arcgis/utils.createMap</a> automatically creates a LabelLayer when a map from <a href="//arcgis.com" target="_blank">arcgis.com</a> includes layers with labeling info.
<li>esri/arcgis/utils.createMap has a new boolean option, <code>usePopupManager</code>, that tells the API to make a map&#8217;s popup respect layer and sublayer visibility so that the popup doesn&#8217;t display information about features that are not visible.
<li>esri/geometry/Extent.intersects returns false when passed a null geometry instead of throwing an error.
<li>Multiple map level changes (clicking the zoom in or zoom out button multiple times, using a mouse scroll wheel) no longer logs <code>undefined ""</code> to a browser&#8217;s console.
      </ul>
