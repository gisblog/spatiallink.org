Historically, FRS has done what it can to improve data quality on the back end, by providing a locational record which aggregates up from the disparate underlying records, with layers of standardization, validation, verification and correction algorithms, as well as working with a national network of data stewards. This has iteratively resulted in vast improvements to the data, correcting common issues such as reversed latitude and longitude values, omitted signs in longitudes, partial or erroneous address fields and so on.<br /><br />However, it still remains that there remain some issues with the data, with the weakness being in how data is collected, imposing limits on what kinds of backend correction can be performed. In most cases, data is captured via basic text fields.

Part of that may involve using licensed commercial APIs to help with address verification and disambiguation, for example, the Bing Maps capability to deal with an incomplete address or one with a typo, such as "1200 Contitutoin, Wash DC" the web services would try to match these and return "Did you mean <em>1200 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC</em>?"<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/TF1rZu1owRI/AAAAAAAAA0M/qg-TD_UD_ro/s1600/AddressDisambiguation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="347" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/TF1rZu1owRI/AAAAAAAAA0M/qg-TD_UD_ro/s640/AddressDisambiguation.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />Between suggesting an alternative which attempts to correct partial and/or incorrect addresses, and providing an aerial photo as a visual cue for verification, it improves the likeihood that the user is going to doublecheck their entry and either accept the suggested alternative or type in a corrected address, along with having the visual verification in the aerial photo. Notionally, if the aerial photo view shows a big open field where there should be a large plastics plant, they would stop and wonder, and perhaps doublecheck the address they had entered.<br /><br />That's certainly a good first step, and is something I'm currently looking to promote on the short term. In talking to some of my EPA stakeholders, they are very interested in this, and I will look at developing some easy-to-integrate code for them to use.<br /><br />But, to think more long-range, let's take that further - from the large universe of facilities that I deal with, not all things populating "address" fields are conventional street addresses. For example, remote mining activities in western states might instead be represented on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System">PLSS system</a>, such as "Sec 17, Twp 6W Range 11N", or rural areas might simply use "Mile 7.5 on FM 1325 S of Anytown" or "PR 155 13.5km west of Anytown".<br /><br />Again, perhaps there are ways to improve this, a longer-term discussion, but certainly the ingredients exist. A first step might be to look at developing guidance on consistent ways to have folks enter this type of data, for example "Sec 17, Twp 6W Range 11N" versus S17-T6W-R11N, along with developing parsers that can understand and standardize the possible permutations that might be entered, including entry of section and meridian info, e.g. NW1/4 SW1/4 SE1/4 SEC 22 T2S R3E MDM for an entry that includes drilldown into quarter sections to identify a 10-acre parcel, also referencing the Mount Diablo Meridian.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Plssinfo.gif/400px-Plssinfo.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Plssinfo.gif/400px-Plssinfo.gif" width="320" /></a></div><br />Currently, there isn't any truly standardized way of entering and managing these, but perhaps there is a role in the surveying community toward standardized nomenclature to assist in database searching and indexing. &nbsp;Coincident with this is potential collaborative development of ways to approach parsing and interpreting nonstandardized entries, along with leveraging existing <a href="http://www.geocommunicator.gov/GeoComm/lsis_home/home/index.shtm">PLSS data</a> and &nbsp;<a href="http://www.geocommunicator.gov/GeoComm/lsis_home/townshipdecoder/index.html">geocoders</a> built toward translating these into locational extents, such as a bounding box, along with provisioning it with appropriate record-level metadata describing elements such as method of derivation and accuracy estimate.<br /><br />In concert with this, obviously, should be an effort toward providing linkages to actual field survey polygonal data, as appropriate if it's a parcel-oriented effort (for example, for superfund site cleanup and brownfields), and where such data is available.<br /><br />Similarly, one could collaboratively develop guidance and parsers for dealing with the route-oriented elements, for example&nbsp;"Mile 7.5 on FM 1325 S of Anytown" or "PR 155 13.5km west of Anytown" toward standardizing these types of fields as well - for example, whether or not to disambiguate or expand FM as "Farm to Market Route", what order to place elements consistently.<br /><br />And then, one would want to leverage routing software to measure the distance along the given route from the given POI, toward providing a roughly-geocoded locational value to get in the ballpark. &nbsp;And again, one would want a web service that does this to return any appropriate metadata on source, error and so on.<br /><br />PLSS locations, mileage-along-a-route locations, and things like this are just a sampling of the universe of possibilities. &nbsp;And as I point out, there are bits and pieces of tools that can do some of these things, but they are currently scattered and uncoordinated, and community-oriented, collaborative efforts can help to pull some of these together.<br /><br />Atop these, as mentioned above one could also provide additional pieces, such as tools for visual verification, at the most basic level, or, if collection mandates permit, tools to allow the user to drop a pushpin on an aerial photo feature, drag a bounding box, or digitize a rough boundary - (and most ultimately of course, a means of entering and/or uploading survey data for field-located monumentation points, boundary topology, and record description data).<br /><br />From a federal perspective, EPA is certainly not the only agency that needs some of these types of tools, and EPA is certainly not the only agency that needs internal policy and/or best practices guidance on how to deal with how these types of values are best represented in databases. &nbsp;It would make sense, from an Enterprise Architecture perspective, for the federal community to collaborate, along with state, tribal and local governments. &nbsp;Similarly, I would think that there are a lot of non-profits, academia and private sector entities that have a big stake in locational data improvement that could benefit from improved data that would be facilitated by such tools, along with benefitting from such tools for data collection themselves.<br /><br />For my part, I will try to do what I can toward leading the charge on these, and to leverage any existing efforts already out there. &nbsp;Additionally, given the capabilities that FRS has, I am looking to continue to integrate across internal stakeholders as well as external agencies toward being able to aggregate, link and reshare, with a process where data is iteratively improved and upgraded collectively.<br /><br />I'd certainly be interested in getting thoughts, ideas and perspectives from others on this.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><A href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/"

&nbsp;Imagine, for example, applications pulling in data from NOAA, NASA, EPA and other agencies? &nbsp;Imagine state environmental agencies pulling in information from federal environmental agencies - the power of open government and transparency begins to multiply and become more and more powerful by orders of magnitude.<br /><br />So what are we talking about? &nbsp;Web services and APIs. &nbsp;Not even anything complex, it could be as simple as REST and JSON, as in the space of public-facing applications, for a vast majority of data-centric or analytical applications, we are generally talking about read-only, non-transactional, nonsensitive data. &nbsp;Why web services or APIs? &nbsp; Isn't something like publishing datasets to Data.gov enough? &nbsp;Publishing datasets to someplace like Data.gov is fine - but consider this - if someone downloads your data and integrates it into their own standalone application, what control do you then have over it? &nbsp;Precious little. &nbsp;When you refresh your database afterward and post a new dataset, is there any assurance that they will come back and get a fresh copy and keep up to date, or do you begin to incur a liability of your data being out of sync as it is represented in someone else's public-facing application? &nbsp;Absolutely.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you post an easy-to-integrate RESTful service or API, you make it far easier to have your data current.<br /><br />Criticisms? &nbsp;Yes, there are many, but we can look at those as well - some might push back and say, "is there sufficient bandwidth and infrastructure for hosting those web services?" &nbsp;The mere fact of web services in and of themselves generally incur no more new bandwidth or infrastructure demand than the public-facing web applications that you are already building. &nbsp;So if that's really a concern, then maybe you shouldn't be building ANY applications. &nbsp;The argument is generally a red herring. <br /><br />Security concerns? &nbsp;Same deal - you are already exposing the data and business logic via your web applications - if you think the web service poses new security concerns, then perhaps you haven't adequately thought through your EXISTING security. &nbsp;So another red herring. <br /><br />"They will come and take all our data!" - Again, why would they, if they know they can grab it dynamically and that you will be assured of their reliance on them by continually posting data refreshes?<br /><br />What about poorly-behaved queries against your web service that might bring your database to its' knees? &nbsp;Same thing - those are things that really should be handled in the logic for your existing application. &nbsp;Better yet, think ahead a bit more and provide options - query filters, such as by a data attribute or domain, bounding boxes for geodata, and so on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/S_k6glcbzmI/AAAAAAAAAzs/w2M8zSY8_a4/s1600/handsholdingearth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/S_k6glcbzmI/AAAAAAAAAzs/w2M8zSY8_a4/s200/handsholdingearth.jpg" width="188" /></a></div>So - in conclusion, this type of thinking can up developers' approaches to how they deal with security, queries and filters, and so on, and generally tighten things up - but in the meantime, also provide a tremendous opportunity for data sharing and integration, whether within an agency, company or office, fostering collaboration across departments and programs, or outside of one's own organization, fostering collaboration across agencies and levels of government, across industry, academia and so on.<br /><br />An individual organization can try all they like to anticipate all of the public's thoughts, needs, interests, they can try to walk in their stakeholders' footsteps - but ultimately, one can never fully anticipate all possibilities, and there are a lot of bright people out there with many untapped ideas - so why not open it up and facilitate that larger collective brainstorm of ideas by providing services ready to integrate?

&nbsp;Same thing - those are things that really should be handled in the logic for your existing application. &nbsp;Better yet, think ahead a bit more and provide options - query filters, such as by a data attribute or domain, bounding boxes for geodata, and so on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/S_k6glcbzmI/AAAAAAAAAzs/w2M8zSY8_a4/s1600/handsholdingearth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/S_k6glcbzmI/AAAAAAAAAzs/w2M8zSY8_a4/s200/handsholdingearth.jpg" width="188" /></a></div>So - in conclusion, this type of thinking can up developers' approaches to how they deal with security, queries and filters, and so on, and generally tighten things up - but in the meantime, also provide a tremendous opportunity for data sharing and integration, whether within an agency, company or office, fostering collaboration across departments and programs, or outside of one's own organization, fostering collaboration across agencies and levels of government, across industry, academia and so on.<br /><br />An individual organization can try all they like to anticipate all of the public's thoughts, needs, interests, they can try to walk in their stakeholders' footsteps - but ultimately, one can never fully anticipate all possibilities, and there are a lot of bright people out there with many untapped ideas - so why not open it up and facilitate that larger collective brainstorm of ideas by providing services ready to integrate? &nbsp;Let's take things like the Open Government Initiative and other good things ongoing in government and elsewhere to the next level - dynamic, services and resources oriented architecture...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><A href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/"

However, having not had anything to eat since morning, I did inhale a handful of various hors d'ouvres and a Heineken...</div><div><br /></div><div>To catch up, I did monitor a few assorted tidbits via <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23feduc">Twitter</a> throughout the day- some of these struck me:</div><div><ul><li><i>Buzzword: VGI. </i> Volunteered Geographic Information.  a/k/a crowdsourcing. All pointing to the  OpenStreetMap paradigm- Given the phenomenal success of OpenStreetMap in supporting base mapping for humanitarian efforts in Haiti, along with the fluid and adaptable nature of its key/value pair model, which was utilized for tagging crisis-related features, such as landslides, collapsed buildings, road obstacles,  refugee camps and so on - how can one NOT talk about OpenStreetMap?   Great to hear about OpenStreetMap being used in ArcGIS.  But...  the pundit in me asks, how transparent is this?  Is it "importing OSM data"?  That's great for many applications.  But what of emergency response applications?  Given the dynamic nature of OpenStreetMap, "import" might not cut it.  How about direct, native OSM support?  That I need to investigate further.  But then, comes the other, far more important piece of VGI - the participatory piece?  Can/will ArcGIS 10 support direct editing of OSM?  And outside of OSM, how much robust ArcGIS 10 capability for participatory GIS exists right out of the box?<br /><br /></li><li><i>Offshoot:  Citizen-centric science.</i>  I understand Audubon demonstrated eBird - interesting - a year ago, I contributed a proof-of-concept to the eBio conference in London, demonstrating harnessing social media such as Twitter to allow citizen science participation to allow folks to record observations of various species in the wild, toward such ends as assessing biodiversity, invasive species, and so on.  I tied this in with web services such as GBIF's lookup services to, for example, translate between common names and scientific name, and so on.  This, in turn, tied in to other sources such as Flickr, and combined, wherever possible, with available geographic information, for providing feeds and display in, for example Bing Maps or other platforms.  Great to see this coming along...  I'd be interested in looking at the Audubon effort more closely, along with further exploring the model for vetting and validating inputs.<br /><br /></li><li><i>The Cloud...</i>   Evidently a big focus on cloud hosting, the new partnership between ESRI and Amazon, and "rent ArcGIS Server by the hour".  I think this is an interesting model and have been harping on this for years.  Geodata services hosting at this point is nothing esoteric, and could/should essentially be commoditized  <i>*cough* GeoServer *cough*</i>. But...  where the less-well-charted and more-interesting territory still lies is not in just serving up data.  ArcGIS Server is frankly often too much tool to waste on just serving up map layers and tiles.  Where I see the opportunity for ArcGIS server is in true ANALYSIS, MODELING and so on.  Web-based geoanalytical services and geoprocessing services.  We need a good model, and some good strategic thinking in the community of how the long-range picture of all of that will look.<br /><br /></li><li><i>ArcGIS for iPhone...</i>  That was another feature of ArcGIS 10 noted by some who attended the Plenary...  Sounds great, but...  I want to know more about how it operates, and more importantly, how customizable, configurable, how many features and functionalities it supports.  Hopefully someone can shed some light there...</li></ul><div>Even for showing up at the last minute, I briefly ran into <a href="http://twitter.com/jfrancica">@jfrancica</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/donatsafe">@donatsafe</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/MikeHardy">@MikeHardy</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/sturich">@sturich</a> from Pen Bay Media and got to say hi to them, as well as various other friends - I know there are plenty more friends, tweeple and geobloggers in town this week - I also did see <a href="http://twitter.com/pbissett">@pbissett</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/cageyjames">@cageyjames</a> from afar - on locating the <a href="http://twitter.com/weogeo">@weogeo</a> booth, it still had a few people milling about, so I unfortunately didn't get to chat... </div><div><br /></div><div>More to follow...

However, having not had anything to eat since morning, I did inhale a handful of various hors d'ouvres and a Heineken...</div><div><br /></div><div>To catch up, I did monitor a few assorted tidbits via <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23feduc">Twitter</a> throughout the day- some of these struck me:</div><div><ul><li><i>Buzzword: VGI. </i> Volunteered Geographic Information.  a/k/a crowdsourcing. All pointing to the  OpenStreetMap paradigm- Given the phenomenal success of OpenStreetMap in supporting base mapping for humanitarian efforts in Haiti, along with the fluid and adaptable nature of its key/value pair model, which was utilized for tagging crisis-related features, such as landslides, collapsed buildings, road obstacles,  refugee camps and so on - how can one NOT talk about OpenStreetMap?   Great to hear about OpenStreetMap being used in ArcGIS.  But...  the pundit in me asks, how transparent is this?  Is it "importing OSM data"?  That's great for many applications.  But what of emergency response applications?  Given the dynamic nature of OpenStreetMap, "import" might not cut it.  How about direct, native OSM support?  That I need to investigate further.  But then, comes the other, far more important piece of VGI - the participatory piece?  Can/will ArcGIS 10 support direct editing of OSM?  And outside of OSM, how much robust ArcGIS 10 capability for participatory GIS exists right out of the box?<br /><br /></li><li><i>Offshoot:  Citizen-centric science.</i>  I understand Audubon demonstrated eBird - interesting - a year ago, I contributed a proof-of-concept to the eBio conference in London, demonstrating harnessing social media such as Twitter to allow citizen science participation to allow folks to record observations of various species in the wild, toward such ends as assessing biodiversity, invasive species, and so on.  I tied this in with web services such as GBIF's lookup services to, for example, translate between common names and scientific name, and so on.  This, in turn, tied in to other sources such as Flickr, and combined, wherever possible, with available geographic information, for providing feeds and display in, for example Bing Maps or other platforms.  Great to see this coming along...  I'd be interested in looking at the Audubon effort more closely, along with further exploring the model for vetting and validating inputs.<br /><br /></li><li><i>The Cloud...</i>   Evidently a big focus on cloud hosting, the new partnership between ESRI and Amazon, and "rent ArcGIS Server by the hour".  I think this is an interesting model and have been harping on this for years.  Geodata services hosting at this point is nothing esoteric, and could/should essentially be commoditized  <i>*cough* GeoServer *cough*</i>. But...  where the less-well-charted and more-interesting territory still lies is not in just serving up data.  ArcGIS Server is frankly often too much tool to waste on just serving up map layers and tiles.  Where I see the opportunity for ArcGIS server is in true ANALYSIS, MODELING and so on.  Web-based geoanalytical services and geoprocessing services.  We need a good model, and some good strategic thinking in the community of how the long-range picture of all of that will look.<br /><br /></li><li><i>ArcGIS for iPhone...</i>  That was another feature of ArcGIS 10 noted by some who attended the Plenary...  Sounds great, but...  I want to know more about how it operates, and more importantly, how customizable, configurable, how many features and functionalities it supports.  Hopefully someone can shed some light there...</li></ul><div>Even for showing up at the last minute, I briefly ran into <a href="http://twitter.com/jfrancica">@jfrancica</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/donatsafe">@donatsafe</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/MikeHardy">@MikeHardy</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/sturich">@sturich</a> from Pen Bay Media and got to say hi to them, as well as various other friends - I know there are plenty more friends, tweeple and geobloggers in town this week - I also did see <a href="http://twitter.com/pbissett">@pbissett</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/cageyjames">@cageyjames</a> from afar - on locating the <a href="http://twitter.com/weogeo">@weogeo</a> booth, it still had a few people milling about, so I unfortunately didn't get to chat... </div><div><br /></div><div>More to follow...  Tomorrow, my luck should be better, and I plan to be able to stay for the whole day - and for <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=geoglobaldomination">#geoglobaldomination</a> afterward.

Currently, useful maps of Haiti are few and far between, in some case there are detailed maps for parts of the country and cities like Jacmel, but which are print maps (no digital edition exists), in many cases many decades old and outdated, in other instances the only maps which exist are small-scale, with limited detail.  Commercial map platforms like Bing Maps, Google Maps and Yahoo vary greatly in their detail as well, and update cycles are slow - however, here, OpenStreetMap has been able to rapidly respond and provide very speedy and robust updates, to include capturing data about collapsed buildings, and so on.<br /><br /><a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/2010/01/14/1518">Mikel Maron</a> captures the speed and effectiveness of OpenStreetMap with these two screenshots of Port-Au-Prince, just before the earthquake and just after:<br /><br />before:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4274264767_c9933d12c5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 379px;" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4274264767_c9933d12c5.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />after:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4274264771_6873e16fa0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 403px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4274264771_6873e16fa0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I would encourage any others who have time to contribute to get involved in this effort as well - editing can be done directly in OpenStreetMap via the 'edit' tab, which opens a web-based tool called <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Potlatch">Potlatch</a> - or, a number of other tools are available as well.  (You will need to register an account in order to edit - feel free to connect with me there as well - <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Dave%20Smith">http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Dave%20Smith</a>).  The <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti">OpenStreetMap WikiProject Haiti</a> page provides a lot of good information and frequent updates.  A number of data sources have been assembled, together with fresh post-earthquake imagery generously donated by companies like <a href="http://www.digitalglobe.com/index.php/48/Products?product_id=26">DigitalGlobe</a>.<br /><br />For folks who are interested in more robust tools, I primarily use <a href="http://www.merkaartor.org/">Merkaartor</a> which runs best on Windows platforms - others favor <a href="http://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM</a> which is Java-based and runs on any platform supporting Java.<br /><br />With either of these, you should be able to use the download function to navigate to an area of Haiti (select a relatively small area) and then download the OSM data<br /><br />Some have wrestled with getting the various available imagery and map services to work properly in JOSM and Merkaartor - they are both a bit clunky about accessing WMS servers - I can offer some of my tips gleaned from a little debugging using <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler2</a>:  For Merkaartor, use Tools -> WMS Servers Editor and create a new entry with the following URL: <a href="http://maps.geography.uc.edu/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/cgn/public_html/maps/mapfiles/haiti.map&amp;version=1.1.0&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap?">http://maps.geography.uc.edu/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/cgn/public_html/maps/mapfiles/haiti.map&amp;version=1.1.0&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap?</a> and show capabilities to access the DigitalGlobe CrisisEvent imagery (DG_crisis_event_service), select EPSG:4326 (only option available) and image/png and you should be able to go from there.

Currently, useful maps of Haiti are few and far between, in some case there are detailed maps for parts of the country and cities like Jacmel, but which are print maps (no digital edition exists), in many cases many decades old and outdated, in other instances the only maps which exist are small-scale, with limited detail.  Commercial map platforms like Bing Maps, Google Maps and Yahoo vary greatly in their detail as well, and update cycles are slow - however, here, OpenStreetMap has been able to rapidly respond and provide very speedy and robust updates, to include capturing data about collapsed buildings, and so on.<br /><br /><a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/2010/01/14/1518">Mikel Maron</a> captures the speed and effectiveness of OpenStreetMap with these two screenshots of Port-Au-Prince, just before the earthquake and just after:<br /><br />before:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4274264767_c9933d12c5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 379px;" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4274264767_c9933d12c5.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />after:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4274264771_6873e16fa0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 403px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2729/4274264771_6873e16fa0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I would encourage any others who have time to contribute to get involved in this effort as well - editing can be done directly in OpenStreetMap via the 'edit' tab, which opens a web-based tool called <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Potlatch">Potlatch</a> - or, a number of other tools are available as well.  (You will need to register an account in order to edit - feel free to connect with me there as well - <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Dave%20Smith">http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Dave%20Smith</a>).  The <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti">OpenStreetMap WikiProject Haiti</a> page provides a lot of good information and frequent updates.  A number of data sources have been assembled, together with fresh post-earthquake imagery generously donated by companies like <a href="http://www.digitalglobe.com/index.php/48/Products?product_id=26">DigitalGlobe</a>.<br /><br />For folks who are interested in more robust tools, I primarily use <a href="http://www.merkaartor.org/">Merkaartor</a> which runs best on Windows platforms - others favor <a href="http://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM</a> which is Java-based and runs on any platform supporting Java.<br /><br />With either of these, you should be able to use the download function to navigate to an area of Haiti (select a relatively small area) and then download the OSM data<br /><br />Some have wrestled with getting the various available imagery and map services to work properly in JOSM and Merkaartor - they are both a bit clunky about accessing WMS servers - I can offer some of my tips gleaned from a little debugging using <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler2</a>:  For Merkaartor, use Tools -> WMS Servers Editor and create a new entry with the following URL: <a href="http://maps.geography.uc.edu/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/cgn/public_html/maps/mapfiles/haiti.map&amp;version=1.1.0&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap?">http://maps.geography.uc.edu/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/home/cgn/public_html/maps/mapfiles/haiti.map&amp;version=1.1.0&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap?</a> and show capabilities to access the DigitalGlobe CrisisEvent imagery (DG_crisis_event_service), select EPSG:4326 (only option available) and image/png and you should be able to go from there.   If there is no image layer showing, go to Layers -> Add new image layer, and then right-click on the newly added image layer and select your newly-added WMS server for DigitalGlobe.<br /><br />Digitization tasks are fairly intuitive - tools allow you to draw points, lines and polygons, as well as to create relations which allow multiple entities to be grouped together - however the absolute key to success is in proper use of <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features">tags</a> to provide attribute values for any entities being created.

Many people are also using GPS for track logs, which can then be uploaded to OSM as GPX to facilitate capture of trails and unmapped streets.</div><div><br /></div><div>In many places, OSM is being used to create maps where there previously were none, such as in developing countries - this might serve efforts such as Engineers Without Borders - and I plan to revisit some of the GIS data I've collected up for places like <a href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/2007/03/cameroon-gis-data-and-benefits-of.html">Cameroon</a> and Rwanda on behalf of EWB and look at getting it posted to OSM where appropriate.</div><div><br /></div><div>Locally, I have been playing with the mapping for my own town - I found that it essentially just had some older TIGER data and Points of Interest (POIs) from USGS Geonames (GNIS).  The road network came up jagged and inaccurate, many features missing, outdated and so on.  Here's where local knowledge and feet on the ground comes into play in crowdsourcing.</div><div><br /></div><div>I essentially started out with something that looks like this:</div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SxCeCjcVbPI/AAAAAAAAAxU/0s-niuKBWYo/s1600/OSM-unfixed.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 220px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SxCeCjcVbPI/AAAAAAAAAxU/0s-niuKBWYo/s400/OSM-unfixed.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408996919182978290" /></a>And have quickly been going to something that looks like this:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SxCeTOp0lWI/AAAAAAAAAxc/2CcADb94yJs/s1600/OSM-Inprogress.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 229px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SxCeTOp0lWI/AAAAAAAAAxc/2CcADb94yJs/s400/OSM-Inprogress.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408997205660177762" /></a>Here, I've been using orthophoto WMS services and other datasets for correcting streets and railroads, digitizing streams, putting in building footprints, parks, trails and amenities, and in just a short time am rapidly going to a useful and reasonably attractive map (note that this is still in progress).  Further, the data can also be reused in a variety of ways, such as in Open Source routing services, using custom styling and symbology and so on.<div><br /></div><div>I would highly encourage others to take a look and play with it: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">http://www.openstreetmap.org/</a> - however, with the caveat that it can be addicting...  </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><A href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/"

Note that this uses the default Jetty install - some folks prefer to run it under Tomcat, which is a different path.<br /><br />So, I started out with the "minimal install CD" for Ubuntu 9.04, available here:<br /><br /><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spp_QMLWbfI/AAAAAAAAAvo/hS_6S9c9fbk/s1600-h/UbuntuMinimal.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 282px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spp_QMLWbfI/AAAAAAAAAvo/hS_6S9c9fbk/s400/UbuntuMinimal.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375749021343575538" /></a><br /><br />Select a package appropriate for the CPU you are using - in my case, I chose Ubuntu 9.04 for 32-bit PC.<br /><br />Burn the ISO and follow the prompts to install from the text-based installer as command-line interface (CLI).  I essentially went with the defaults.  You will want to have the machine connected to the internet so that it can identify and set up the network connection and grab any files needed during install.<br /><br />Once you've installed a minimal version of Linux, you will be ready to configure and install the other goodies.<div><br /></div><div>For remote administration, you may want to install OpenSSH- <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">http://www.openssh.com/</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spp_Y_dxUTI/AAAAAAAAAvw/7tl1A-PmD0I/s1600-h/OpenSSH.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 282px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spp_Y_dxUTI/AAAAAAAAAvw/7tl1A-PmD0I/s400/OpenSSH.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375749172549996850" /></a><br /><br />The step for doing this is simple:<br /><br />Log in to your Linux machine, and use the following command:<br /><br /><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code><br /><br />This will download and install the OpenSSH package.  For folks new to Linux, <code>sudo</code> tells it to use superuser privileges and permissions, and will ask for the root password used when you installed Linux.  <code>apt-get install</code> uses the Advanced Package Tool to search for, retrieve and install software packages for Linux - this makes installation of much standard software in Linux easy.<br /><br />For remote administration, you'll want to know how to reach your machine on the network - you can get the IP address by using the <code>ifconfig</code> command, which will give results something like this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spp_nIwwDUI/AAAAAAAAAv4/ZpuUjU7-H8A/s1600-h/ifconfig.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 397px; height: 166px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spp_nIwwDUI/AAAAAAAAAv4/ZpuUjU7-H8A/s400/ifconfig.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375749415563693378" /></a><br /><br />If you use Windows as a primary OS for your other work, you can then access the box from a Windows machine using an SSH client.  I usually use PuTTY:  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqAo0-F_pI/AAAAAAAAAwA/7ECm_pfaybw/s1600-h/PuTTY.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 282px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqAo0-F_pI/AAAAAAAAAwA/7ECm_pfaybw/s400/PuTTY.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375750544122314386" /></a><br /><br />From there, you can install PuTTY on your windows machine and then access the Linux box via command-line interface remotely for administration.<br /><br />Plug in the IP address you got above:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqBh8Y9D3I/AAAAAAAAAwI/Iq2VJAIEiUA/s1600-h/PuTTYSession1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 383px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqBh8Y9D3I/AAAAAAAAAwI/Iq2VJAIEiUA/s400/PuTTYSession1.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375751525366566770" /></a><br /><br />and voila - you should be presented with a login screen for your linux box:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqCC2AiThI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/aTrxM8uYNZM/s1600-h/PuTTYSession2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqCC2AiThI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/aTrxM8uYNZM/s400/PuTTYSession2.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375752090589220370" /></a><br /><br />Tools like PuTTY are a great asset when it comes to administering boxes.<br /><br />Side trip into remote administration aside, on to the REAL stuff:  Installing GeoServer.<br /><br />As a prerequisite, you will need to install the Java JDK - the GeoServer install page gives some recommendations, and here's how you would do it from the command line:<br /><br /><code>sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk</code><br /><br />Next, you will need to do some configuration of the JDK<br /><br />Define the default Java to use:<br /><code>sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun</code><br /><br />And set the JAVA_HOME directory - this is doable in a number of ways, you may or may not want to define it in /etc/environment.  I really like 'nano' as an editor for command-line Linux environments and it comes pre-installed in the minimal Ubuntu 9.04 version.<br /><br /><code>sudo nano /etc/environment</code><br /><br />Again 'sudo' makes sure you have an appropriate privilege level to write the changes.<br /><br />In nano, you can navigate around in the file using your arrow keys.  Insert the following:<br /><br /><code>JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.14/</code><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqEvYrLl6I/AAAAAAAAAwY/YG2iRmXdero/s1600-h/etc_environment.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqEvYrLl6I/AAAAAAAAAwY/YG2iRmXdero/s400/etc_environment.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375755054832392098" /></a><br /></div><div>nano is intuitive and easy to use, following the commands along the bottom of the screen, e.g. ctrl-O to write changes, ctrl-X to exit.<br /><br />Now on to the fun stuff - installing GeoServer.<br /><br />GeoServer isn't available via apt - so you will need to download and unzip it to install it.<br /><br />To be able to use ZIP archives, <code>sudo apt-get install unzip</code> will provide that capability.  Next, you can download GeoServer.</div><div><br /></div><div>Decide where you want to put it - some folks put it in /usr/local, or /usr/share, or if you are just experimenting, you could even leave it in your home directory - if putting it /usr/share in you would <code>cd /usr/share</code><br /><br />To download it, the download location given on the GeoServer page is <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip</a></div><a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip"></a><div><br /></div>Thus, to download it, use  <code>wget </code>-<br /><code><br /></code><div><code>sudo wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip</code><br /><br /></div><div>Then, unzip it<div><br /></div><div><code>sudo unzip geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip</code><br /></div></div>and you should see the files extracting into a geoserver-1.7.6 folder.<br /><br />Depending on where you put it and privileges held by the account you are using, you may also need to ensure you have ability to access and run GeoServer and that GeoServer can create any files it needs.<br /><br /><code>chown</code> will change ownership, using <code>-R</code> makes it recursive through subfolders and files:<br /><br /><code>sudo chown -R <i>geoserver_username</i> geoserver-1.7.6</code> would change all files and directories to be owned by the user specified (<code>geoserver_username</code> as a placeholder).<br /><br />You can list files using <code>ls</code> and navigate directories using <code>cd</code>.<br /><br />You may or may not also then want to configure directories, such as defining the location of your GeoServer installation directory, e.g. <code>GEOSERVER_HOME="/usr/share/geoserver-1.7.6"</code> - again, you could do this using <code>nano</code> to edit <code>/etc/environment</code> - and there are also plenty of other ways to do this.  You could also define other parts of GeoServer, such as <code>GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR</code> at this point as well - consult the GeoServer docs for details there...  <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/1.7.x/en/user/">http://docs.geoserver.org/1.7.x/en/user/</a><div><br />Pretty much ready to run now...  <code>cd</code> to the <code>/bin</code> directory under your geoserver install, e.g. <code>cd /usr/share/geoserver-1.7.6/bin"</code> and launch the startup script <code>sh startup.sh</code> and voila...   You will see some program output scroll by,<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SprDinRC0SI/AAAAAAAAAw4/yx4UbuTWwuQ/s1600-h/GeoServer_bootup.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SprDinRC0SI/AAAAAAAAAw4/yx4UbuTWwuQ/s400/GeoServer_bootup.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375824104643547426" /></a>ultimately resulting with an output line like<br /><br /><code>[main] INFO org.mortbay.log - Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080</code> - this should tell you that the GeoServer Jetty container is up and listening for connections on 8080.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, open a browser, point it to your machine's IP address and enter it, pointing to port 8080 and the geoserver instance, e.g. <code>http://192.168.2.125:8080/geoserver/</code> and after an initial "loading" screen you should get the GeoServer web interface:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spqs24UAj4I/AAAAAAAAAwo/ryHIeFooeAI/s1600-h/GeoServer_Web.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 282px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spqs24UAj4I/AAAAAAAAAwo/ryHIeFooeAI/s400/GeoServer_Web.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375799164049330050" /></a><br /><br />And you are off to the races...

I usually use PuTTY:  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqAo0-F_pI/AAAAAAAAAwA/7ECm_pfaybw/s1600-h/PuTTY.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 282px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqAo0-F_pI/AAAAAAAAAwA/7ECm_pfaybw/s400/PuTTY.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375750544122314386" /></a><br /><br />From there, you can install PuTTY on your windows machine and then access the Linux box via command-line interface remotely for administration.<br /><br />Plug in the IP address you got above:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqBh8Y9D3I/AAAAAAAAAwI/Iq2VJAIEiUA/s1600-h/PuTTYSession1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 383px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqBh8Y9D3I/AAAAAAAAAwI/Iq2VJAIEiUA/s400/PuTTYSession1.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375751525366566770" /></a><br /><br />and voila - you should be presented with a login screen for your linux box:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqCC2AiThI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/aTrxM8uYNZM/s1600-h/PuTTYSession2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqCC2AiThI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/aTrxM8uYNZM/s400/PuTTYSession2.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375752090589220370" /></a><br /><br />Tools like PuTTY are a great asset when it comes to administering boxes.<br /><br />Side trip into remote administration aside, on to the REAL stuff:  Installing GeoServer.<br /><br />As a prerequisite, you will need to install the Java JDK - the GeoServer install page gives some recommendations, and here's how you would do it from the command line:<br /><br /><code>sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk</code><br /><br />Next, you will need to do some configuration of the JDK<br /><br />Define the default Java to use:<br /><code>sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun</code><br /><br />And set the JAVA_HOME directory - this is doable in a number of ways, you may or may not want to define it in /etc/environment.  I really like 'nano' as an editor for command-line Linux environments and it comes pre-installed in the minimal Ubuntu 9.04 version.<br /><br /><code>sudo nano /etc/environment</code><br /><br />Again 'sudo' makes sure you have an appropriate privilege level to write the changes.<br /><br />In nano, you can navigate around in the file using your arrow keys.  Insert the following:<br /><br /><code>JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.14/</code><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqEvYrLl6I/AAAAAAAAAwY/YG2iRmXdero/s1600-h/etc_environment.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SpqEvYrLl6I/AAAAAAAAAwY/YG2iRmXdero/s400/etc_environment.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375755054832392098" /></a><br /></div><div>nano is intuitive and easy to use, following the commands along the bottom of the screen, e.g. ctrl-O to write changes, ctrl-X to exit.<br /><br />Now on to the fun stuff - installing GeoServer.<br /><br />GeoServer isn't available via apt - so you will need to download and unzip it to install it.<br /><br />To be able to use ZIP archives, <code>sudo apt-get install unzip</code> will provide that capability.  Next, you can download GeoServer.</div><div><br /></div><div>Decide where you want to put it - some folks put it in /usr/local, or /usr/share, or if you are just experimenting, you could even leave it in your home directory - if putting it /usr/share in you would <code>cd /usr/share</code><br /><br />To download it, the download location given on the GeoServer page is <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip</a></div><a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip"></a><div><br /></div>Thus, to download it, use  <code>wget </code>-<br /><code><br /></code><div><code>sudo wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip</code><br /><br /></div><div>Then, unzip it<div><br /></div><div><code>sudo unzip geoserver-1.7.6-bin.zip</code><br /></div></div>and you should see the files extracting into a geoserver-1.7.6 folder.<br /><br />Depending on where you put it and privileges held by the account you are using, you may also need to ensure you have ability to access and run GeoServer and that GeoServer can create any files it needs.<br /><br /><code>chown</code> will change ownership, using <code>-R</code> makes it recursive through subfolders and files:<br /><br /><code>sudo chown -R <i>geoserver_username</i> geoserver-1.7.6</code> would change all files and directories to be owned by the user specified (<code>geoserver_username</code> as a placeholder).<br /><br />You can list files using <code>ls</code> and navigate directories using <code>cd</code>.<br /><br />You may or may not also then want to configure directories, such as defining the location of your GeoServer installation directory, e.g. <code>GEOSERVER_HOME="/usr/share/geoserver-1.7.6"</code> - again, you could do this using <code>nano</code> to edit <code>/etc/environment</code> - and there are also plenty of other ways to do this.  You could also define other parts of GeoServer, such as <code>GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR</code> at this point as well - consult the GeoServer docs for details there...  <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/1.7.x/en/user/">http://docs.geoserver.org/1.7.x/en/user/</a><div><br />Pretty much ready to run now...  <code>cd</code> to the <code>/bin</code> directory under your geoserver install, e.g. <code>cd /usr/share/geoserver-1.7.6/bin"</code> and launch the startup script <code>sh startup.sh</code> and voila...   You will see some program output scroll by,<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SprDinRC0SI/AAAAAAAAAw4/yx4UbuTWwuQ/s1600-h/GeoServer_bootup.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SprDinRC0SI/AAAAAAAAAw4/yx4UbuTWwuQ/s400/GeoServer_bootup.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375824104643547426" /></a>ultimately resulting with an output line like<br /><br /><code>[main] INFO org.mortbay.log - Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080</code> - this should tell you that the GeoServer Jetty container is up and listening for connections on 8080.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, open a browser, point it to your machine's IP address and enter it, pointing to port 8080 and the geoserver instance, e.g. <code>http://192.168.2.125:8080/geoserver/</code> and after an initial "loading" screen you should get the GeoServer web interface:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spqs24UAj4I/AAAAAAAAAwo/ryHIeFooeAI/s1600-h/GeoServer_Web.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 282px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spqs24UAj4I/AAAAAAAAAwo/ryHIeFooeAI/s400/GeoServer_Web.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375799164049330050" /></a><br /><br />And you are off to the races...  Confirm that it works via the demos:<br /><br />OpenLayers NYC Tiger map<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spqt34JY1EI/AAAAAAAAAww/iqTHAEyexsk/s1600-h/GeoServer_OL_Tiger.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 285px; height: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/Spqt34JY1EI/AAAAAAAAAww/iqTHAEyexsk/s400/GeoServer_OL_Tiger.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5375800280696280130" /></a><br />Again, this is just meant to be a quick-and-dirty guide - enough to make even someone with minimal Linux experience armed and dangerous - and from here, there are many tweaks and customizations that can be made, such as optimizing performance, hardening and security and so on (there are plenty of discussions around the web and on listservs regarding this)- but I figured, I'd at least share this as a quick start for anyone looking to play with GeoServer in a minimal Linux environment...</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><A href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/"

Other highlights "Maryland is ESRI Customer #008" -<br />He discussed trying to remedy many of the issues facing Baltimore, "hopeless &amp; vacant hearts" and how CityStat <a href="http://www.baltimorecity.gov/government/citistat/">http://www.baltimorecity.gov/government/citistat/</a> and iMap <a href="http://maps.baltimorecity.gov/imap/">http://maps.baltimorecity.gov/imap/</a>  have provided far more performance-oriented approaches - he touched on how previously, information had been collected in such a way as to not make it to management in any meaningful way, with emphasis on measurement of inputs, but not of outputs and outcomes - and the new paradigm of viewing outcomes against the map, tells where challenges lie.  These types of geospatial approaches allow relentless followup and assessment, and drive the effort to move the graphs in right direction, with improvements in city services, reductions in shootings and homicides, improved response times - cleaning out and boarding of vacant houses, mapping service problems and opportunities for daily review.  "The map does not care if neighborhood is white/black, rich/poor, republican/democrat"<br /><br />As Governor now, he has taken this mapping-oriented and performance-oriented approach to the next level on a statewide level, with StateStat <a href="http://www.statestat.maryland.gov/">http://www.statestat.maryland.gov/</a> and BayStat <a href="http://www.baystat.maryland.gov/">http://www.baystat.maryland.gov/</a>, and GreenPrint, which provides an ecological assessment of every single parcel in Maryland, along with ecological measures being put in force:  <a href="http://www.greenprint.maryland.gov/">http://www.greenprint.maryland.gov/</a> - and tie-in of stakeholders at all levels - "if it's not about the relationship, it's not about anything".<br /><br />Governor O'Malley left the audience with a Native American proverb, "<span style="font-style: italic;">how we treat one another is reflected in how we treat the earth</span>"<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SZzdZIVTIcI/AAAAAAAAAs8/d6z_K7_JZNA/s1600-h/IMAGE_902.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SZzdZIVTIcI/AAAAAAAAAs8/d6z_K7_JZNA/s200/IMAGE_902.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304357884938887618" border="0" /></a>I did visit the EXPO floor and looked at some of the maps - the floor was definitely quite crowded.

Other highlights "Maryland is ESRI Customer #008" -<br />He discussed trying to remedy many of the issues facing Baltimore, "hopeless &amp; vacant hearts" and how CityStat <a href="http://www.baltimorecity.gov/government/citistat/">http://www.baltimorecity.gov/government/citistat/</a> and iMap <a href="http://maps.baltimorecity.gov/imap/">http://maps.baltimorecity.gov/imap/</a>  have provided far more performance-oriented approaches - he touched on how previously, information had been collected in such a way as to not make it to management in any meaningful way, with emphasis on measurement of inputs, but not of outputs and outcomes - and the new paradigm of viewing outcomes against the map, tells where challenges lie.  These types of geospatial approaches allow relentless followup and assessment, and drive the effort to move the graphs in right direction, with improvements in city services, reductions in shootings and homicides, improved response times - cleaning out and boarding of vacant houses, mapping service problems and opportunities for daily review.  "The map does not care if neighborhood is white/black, rich/poor, republican/democrat"<br /><br />As Governor now, he has taken this mapping-oriented and performance-oriented approach to the next level on a statewide level, with StateStat <a href="http://www.statestat.maryland.gov/">http://www.statestat.maryland.gov/</a> and BayStat <a href="http://www.baystat.maryland.gov/">http://www.baystat.maryland.gov/</a>, and GreenPrint, which provides an ecological assessment of every single parcel in Maryland, along with ecological measures being put in force:  <a href="http://www.greenprint.maryland.gov/">http://www.greenprint.maryland.gov/</a> - and tie-in of stakeholders at all levels - "if it's not about the relationship, it's not about anything".<br /><br />Governor O'Malley left the audience with a Native American proverb, "<span style="font-style: italic;">how we treat one another is reflected in how we treat the earth</span>"<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SZzdZIVTIcI/AAAAAAAAAs8/d6z_K7_JZNA/s1600-h/IMAGE_902.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SZzdZIVTIcI/AAAAAAAAAs8/d6z_K7_JZNA/s200/IMAGE_902.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304357884938887618" border="0" /></a>I did visit the EXPO floor and looked at some of the maps - the floor was definitely quite crowded.

And what does Kundra’s selection mean in this mix? Only Kundra really has the answer to this, at present - however I do believe that we can make some informed guesses as to what may be on his mind, based on his past track record and accomplishments. District of Columbia’s Open Data Catalog? Think in terms of doing this across all of Federal government. Strengthen and bolster the existing <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a016/a016_rev.html">OMB A-16 mandate</a>, and drive publishing of open data. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic">That certainly forms some excellent pieces of the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/2009/01/national-spatial-data-infrastructure-20.html">National Spatial Data Infrastructure</a></span>. </span></div><div><br /></div><div>Foster partnership-building and collaboration, ala the Apps for Democracy effort. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3uY30D_CI/AAAAAAAAAr0/FG89WgmmH3Y/s1600-h/Forge_Mil.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5300154447551527970" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 155px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3uY30D_CI/AAAAAAAAAr0/FG89WgmmH3Y/s200/Forge_Mil.jpg" border="0" /></a>Perhaps, on a cross-government level, we should also be looking at approaches such as <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2009/01/30/dod-launches-site-to-develop-open-source-software.aspx">Forge.mil</a>, where agencies can collaborate and share GOTS technology investments, and work together to enhance and expand technology and capability, as opposed to continually reinventing the wheel.<br /><br /></div><div>Other things for Kundra to look at? Alignment of efforts across government. Currently USGS and EPA collaborate on efforts to build and densify hydrology data, as the National Hydrology Dataset (NHD), and are working with states to get this to a 1:4,800 level. Meanwhile, FEMA is developing DFIRMs for flood mapping, based on county and other types of data for stream centerlines. How do we align such things as linear referencing between USGS stream gauges and FEMA for looking at flooding issues? Coordinate between NOAA and NWS for realtime storm tracking, and have models available, using all best-possible data, toward stream flood prediction? What if a truck tumbles off of a bridge and ends up in a river, releasing hazardous waste into the river – is the information flow adequate to deal with hazardous waste cleanup even where that river crosses the border into the next state downstream? Pieces and parts of these types of things are starting to happen, but where they do, it is typically only in an ad-hoc, reactive fashion, with very limited coordination or common framework. Where does one thing end and the next begin? What are the gaps? Overlaps?<br /><br /></div><div>Or, consider a military convoy, heading across multiple states to an exercise. Due to an emergency bridge closure, they are diverted off of the main highway and onto local roads. They may be carrying sensitive and/or high value goods, such as weapons systems. Who knows? Who SHOULD know? Perhaps local bridge weight restrictions restrict their travel even further. How do we handle this in any coordinated fashion? Who’s doing what, and who’s able to supply what data to smoothly deal with these types of situations? Federal government places some mandates on states to collect roadway data, but again, <a href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/2009/02/need-for-integrated-physical-and.html">is there any mechanism for establishing data capture, transparent access and flow</a>? What’s covered, and what isn’t? State-to-state, if there is a serious roadway closure issue just inside one state’s border, will the adjacent state know this and be able to notify motorists via VMS boards and other means?<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3wjVEQ8QI/AAAAAAAAAr8/n_FeE8Nlklw/s1600-h/edge_of_the_world2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5300156826226061570" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 158px" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3wjVEQ8QI/AAAAAAAAAr8/n_FeE8Nlklw/s200/edge_of_the_world2.jpg" border="0" /></a></div><div>Although there are a few exceptions here and there, more often than not, the answer to these types of questions and scenarios is “no/had no idea/what am I supposed to do about it” accompanied by shrugs. Streams do not care about political boundaries, they only understand watersheds. Roads are networks. Cars and trucks do not just reach the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Edge of the Knowne Worlde</span> and drift off into space when they cross the state line. Information access and flows must be able to bridge these gaps.<br /><br /></div><div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3yJVarqoI/AAAAAAAAAsE/bjuITcTLhRU/s1600-h/light_bulb_gold.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5300158578666744450" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 100px" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3yJVarqoI/AAAAAAAAAsE/bjuITcTLhRU/s200/light_bulb_gold.jpg" border="0" /></a>It’s pretty much a given that 90% of most business processes in Federal government touch on or deal with location in some form or fashion. Where are assets, where are people, who’s being served, and so on. Through implementation of best practices and through making data access and exchange more timely, transparent, and complete, through better alignment of technology investments and reduction of gaps and overlaps, these *shrug* moments start to vanish, and the *AHA* moments start to happen. I am hoping that Mr. Kundra is thinking the same way. If what lies ahead of us is anything like his efforts to date, we indeed have a bright future ahead of us. </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><A href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/"

Strengthen and bolster the existing <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a016/a016_rev.html">OMB A-16 mandate</a>, and drive publishing of open data. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic">That certainly forms some excellent pieces of the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/2009/01/national-spatial-data-infrastructure-20.html">National Spatial Data Infrastructure</a></span>. </span></div><div><br /></div><div>Foster partnership-building and collaboration, ala the Apps for Democracy effort. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3uY30D_CI/AAAAAAAAAr0/FG89WgmmH3Y/s1600-h/Forge_Mil.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5300154447551527970" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 155px" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3uY30D_CI/AAAAAAAAAr0/FG89WgmmH3Y/s200/Forge_Mil.jpg" border="0" /></a>Perhaps, on a cross-government level, we should also be looking at approaches such as <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2009/01/30/dod-launches-site-to-develop-open-source-software.aspx">Forge.mil</a>, where agencies can collaborate and share GOTS technology investments, and work together to enhance and expand technology and capability, as opposed to continually reinventing the wheel.<br /><br /></div><div>Other things for Kundra to look at? Alignment of efforts across government. Currently USGS and EPA collaborate on efforts to build and densify hydrology data, as the National Hydrology Dataset (NHD), and are working with states to get this to a 1:4,800 level. Meanwhile, FEMA is developing DFIRMs for flood mapping, based on county and other types of data for stream centerlines. How do we align such things as linear referencing between USGS stream gauges and FEMA for looking at flooding issues? Coordinate between NOAA and NWS for realtime storm tracking, and have models available, using all best-possible data, toward stream flood prediction? What if a truck tumbles off of a bridge and ends up in a river, releasing hazardous waste into the river – is the information flow adequate to deal with hazardous waste cleanup even where that river crosses the border into the next state downstream? Pieces and parts of these types of things are starting to happen, but where they do, it is typically only in an ad-hoc, reactive fashion, with very limited coordination or common framework. Where does one thing end and the next begin? What are the gaps? Overlaps?<br /><br /></div><div>Or, consider a military convoy, heading across multiple states to an exercise. Due to an emergency bridge closure, they are diverted off of the main highway and onto local roads. They may be carrying sensitive and/or high value goods, such as weapons systems. Who knows? Who SHOULD know? Perhaps local bridge weight restrictions restrict their travel even further. How do we handle this in any coordinated fashion? Who’s doing what, and who’s able to supply what data to smoothly deal with these types of situations? Federal government places some mandates on states to collect roadway data, but again, <a href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/2009/02/need-for-integrated-physical-and.html">is there any mechanism for establishing data capture, transparent access and flow</a>? What’s covered, and what isn’t? State-to-state, if there is a serious roadway closure issue just inside one state’s border, will the adjacent state know this and be able to notify motorists via VMS boards and other means?<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3wjVEQ8QI/AAAAAAAAAr8/n_FeE8Nlklw/s1600-h/edge_of_the_world2.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5300156826226061570" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 158px" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3wjVEQ8QI/AAAAAAAAAr8/n_FeE8Nlklw/s200/edge_of_the_world2.jpg" border="0" /></a></div><div>Although there are a few exceptions here and there, more often than not, the answer to these types of questions and scenarios is “no/had no idea/what am I supposed to do about it” accompanied by shrugs. Streams do not care about political boundaries, they only understand watersheds. Roads are networks. Cars and trucks do not just reach the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Edge of the Knowne Worlde</span> and drift off into space when they cross the state line. Information access and flows must be able to bridge these gaps.<br /><br /></div><div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3yJVarqoI/AAAAAAAAAsE/bjuITcTLhRU/s1600-h/light_bulb_gold.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5300158578666744450" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 100px" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SY3yJVarqoI/AAAAAAAAAsE/bjuITcTLhRU/s200/light_bulb_gold.jpg" border="0" /></a>It’s pretty much a given that 90% of most business processes in Federal government touch on or deal with location in some form or fashion. Where are assets, where are people, who’s being served, and so on. Through implementation of best practices and through making data access and exchange more timely, transparent, and complete, through better alignment of technology investments and reduction of gaps and overlaps, these *shrug* moments start to vanish, and the *AHA* moments start to happen. I am hoping that Mr. Kundra is thinking the same way. If what lies ahead of us is anything like his efforts to date, we indeed have a bright future ahead of us. </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><A href="http://surveying-mapping-gis.blogspot.com/"

A substantial amount of data is collected and developed at the local level.

Some of this data is generated on a regular basis, as part of an established program; some is purely on an ad-hoc basis.

A substantial amount of data is collected and developed at the local level.  Some is collected and developed at the state and federal level, some by tribes, some by academia, some by non-profits, and some by private sector.  Some of this data is generated on a regular basis, as part of an established program; some is purely on an ad-hoc basis.  Some is mandated, such as some of the data collected on environmental data through the <a href="http://www.exchangenetwork.net/">National Environmental Information Exchange Network</a>, some is collected, purely incidental to other activities.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SYU3CTMEbuI/AAAAAAAAAq0/Muzgmubh2ng/s1600-h/Patchwork1.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 175px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SYU3CTMEbuI/AAAAAAAAAq0/Muzgmubh2ng/s320/Patchwork1.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5297701049321418466" /></a>Some datasets exist on a national basis, some do not.  And all throughout, there are myriad overlapping use cases, which may additionally place differing requirements on datasets.  For example, in some cases, a roadway GIS dataset may be geared to roadway maintenance needs; in others, toward network and traffic analysis.  In some cases, the requirements, dataset characteristics and attributes can converge and be accommodated in a single dataset.  In others, they may not be able to converge, but the needed datasets can be developed by means of value-added attributes or joins.  In some cases, derivative data is required.  In many cases, there is tremendous need for consistency and authoritative datasets.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SYU3LejnFuI/AAAAAAAAAq8/eCc9J0WZqQQ/s1600-h/Patchwork2.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 175px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JC5QBrZcQWw/SYU3LejnFuI/AAAAAAAAAq8/eCc9J0WZqQQ/s320/Patchwork2.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5297701206991771362" /></a>The landscape that quickly begins to emerge is one which is a patchwork, full of seams, overlaps, disjoints, gaps and disconnects- but- also one <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">which holds much potential</span></span> for leveraging disparate investments, and providing economies of scale, along with increasing richness of data, increased update frequency, increased accuracy and completeness.<br /><br />How can these gaps and disjoints be bridged?
