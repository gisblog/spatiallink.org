People are often mixing the above as if they were one and the same, so here’s a recap
of them. One of the things you often find people saying is that “my data is in the
WGS84 coordinate system”. This doesn’t really make sense, but I will get back to this
later.

This is a very confusing subject, and I might have gotten a few things wrong myself,
so please add a comment and I’ll update it ASAP.

          
        
A coordinate system is simply put a way of describing a spatial property relative
to a center. There is more than one way of doing this:

            
          
        
Some of the common properties of the above coordinate systems are that they are all
relative to the center of Earth and except the Geocentric coordinate system, uses
a height system relative to the surface of the earth.

This poses two immediate problems:

          By
now most people should know that that the earth isn’t flat (although ). If we define the surface of Earth as being at the
mean sea level (often referred to as the Geoid), we don’t get a spheroid or even an
ellipsoid. Because of gravitational changes often caused by large masses such as mountain
ranges etc, Earth is actually very irregular with variations of +/- 100 meters. Since
this is not very practical to work with as a model of earth, we usually use an ellipsoid
for approximation. The ellipsoid is defined by its semi-major axis, and either the
flattening of the semi-minor axis.

The center and orientation of the ellipsoid is what we call the datum. So the datum
defines an ellipsoid and through the use of a set of points on the ground that we
relate to points on the ellipsoid, we define the center of the Earth.  This poses
another problem, because continental drift moves the points used to define the points
around all the time. This is why the name of a datum usually have a year in it, often
referring to the position of those points January 1st of that year (although that
may vary).

There are a vast amount of datums, some used for measurements all over the world,
and other local datums defined so they fit very well with a local area. Some common
ones are:  (WGS84),  (ED50) and  (NAD83).

The most well-known is WGS84 used by the GPS systems today. It is a good approximation
of the entire world and fix-points defined almost all over the world. When it was
defined they forgot to include points in Europe though, so the Europeans now have
their own ETRS89, which is usually referred to as the “realization of WGS84 in Europe”.
The problem here was solely because of continental drift, so they defined some points
relative to WGS84 in 1989, and keeps track of the changes. In most use-cases it is
of no real importance and you can use one or the other.

I mentioned earlier that people often refer to having their data in WGS84, and you
see now why this doesn’t make sense. All you know from that is that the data is defined
using the WGS84 datum, but you don’t know which coordinate system it uses.

          
        
The earth isn’t flat, and there is no simple way of putting it down on a flat paper
map (or these days a flat screen), so people have come up with all sorts of ingenious
solutions each with their pros and cons. Some preserves area, so all objects have
a relative size to each other, others preserve angles (conformal) like the Mercator
projection, some try to find a good intermediate mix with only little distortion on
several parameters etc. Common to them all is that they transform the world onto a
flat Cartesian coordinate system.

A common statement that I hear in GIS is the following “My map doesn’t have a projection”,
but this is simply not possible (unless you have a good old globe). Often people are
referring to data that is in longitude/latitude and displayed on a map without applying
any projection. What happens is that the system applies the simplest projection it
can: Mapping Longitude directly to X and Latitude to Y. This results in an equirectangular
projection, also called the “Plate Carree” projection. It results in very heavy distortion
making areas look squashed close to the poles. The “opposite” of the Plate Carree
is the Mercator projection which stretches areas close to the poles in the opposite
direction, making them look very big. This is the type of projection you see used
on ,  and , but as many often mistakenly
thinks, they do NOT use WGS84.

          
        
The spatial reference is a combination of all the above. It defines an ellipsoid,
a datum using that ellipsoid, and either a geocentric, geographic or projection. The
projection also always has a geographic coordinate system associated with it. The  (EPSG) has a huge set of predefined spatial references,
each given a unique ID. These ID’s are used throughout the industry and you can download
an Access database with all them from their website, as well as some very good documents
on projection.

So when you hear someone saying they have their data in WGS84, you might as well assume
they have longitude/latitude data in WGS84 projected using Plate Carree.  The
spatial reference ID of this is EPSG:4326.

Spatial References are often defined in a Well-known format defining all these parameters.
The Spatial Reference EPSG:4326 can therefore also be written as:

          
        
Live/Google/Yahoo maps use a Mercator projection, but although their datum is based
on WGS84, they use a sphere instead of an ellipsoid. This means that they use the
same center and orientation as WGS84, but without applying any flattening. The spatial
reference string for their projection therefore becomes:

        ";s:10:"body_ul_li";s:1454:"
The Geocentric coordinate system is based on a normal (X,Y,Z) coordinate system with
the origin at the center of Earth. This is the system that GPS uses internally for
doing it calculations, but since this is very unpractical to work with as a human
being ( due to the lack of well-known concepts of east, north, up, down) it is rarely
displayed to the user but converted to another coordinate system.
The Spherical coordinate system is probably the most well-known. It is based on angles
relative to a prime meridian and Equator usually as Longitude and Latitude. Heights
are usually given relative to either the mean sea level or the datum (I’ll get back
to the datum later).
The Cartesian coordinate system is defined as a “flat” coordinate system placed
on the surface of Earth.  In some projections it’s not flat in the sense that
it follows the earth’s curvature in one direction and has a known scale-error
in the other direction relative to the distance of the origin. The most well-known
coordinate system is the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), but surveyors define
their own little local flat coordinate systems all the time. It is very easy to work
with, fairly accurate over small distances making measurements such as length,
angle and area very straightforward. Cartesian coordinate systems are strongly connected
to projections that I will cover later.

any projection. What happens is that the system applies the simplest projection it
can: Mapping Longitude directly to X and Latitude to Y. This results in an equirectangular
projection, also called the “Plate Carree” projection. It results in very heavy distortion
making areas look squashed close to the poles. The “opposite” of the Plate Carree
is the Mercator projection which stretches areas close to the poles in the opposite
direction, making them look very big. This is the type of projection you see used
on <a href="http://maps.live.com">Live maps</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google
maps</a> and <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com">Yahoo maps</a>, but as many often mistakenly
thinks, they do NOT use WGS84.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spatial reference</strong>
</p>
<p>
The spatial reference is a combination of all the above. It defines an ellipsoid,
a datum using that ellipsoid, and either a geocentric, geographic or projection. The
projection also always has a geographic coordinate system associated with it. The <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">European
Petroleum Survey Group</a> (EPSG) has a huge set of predefined spatial references,
each given a unique ID. These ID’s are used throughout the industry and you can download
an Access database with all them from their website, as well as some very good documents
on projection.
</p>
<p>
So when you hear someone saying they have their data in WGS84, you might as well assume
they have longitude/latitude data in WGS84 projected using Plate Carree.&nbsp; The
spatial reference ID of this is EPSG:4326.
</p>
<p>
Spatial References are often defined in a Well-known format defining all these parameters.
The Spatial Reference EPSG:4326 can therefore also be written as:
</p>
<p>
<font face="Courier New">GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]]</font>
</p>
<p>
Live/Google/Yahoo maps use a Mercator projection, but although their datum is based
on WGS84, they use a sphere instead of an ellipsoid. This means that they use the
same center and orientation as WGS84, but without applying any flattening. The spatial
reference string for their projection therefore becomes:

People are often mixing the above as if they were one and the same, so here’s a recap
of them. One of the things you often find people saying is that “my data is in the
WGS84 coordinate system”. This doesn’t really make sense, but I will get back to this
later.
</p>
<p>
This is a very confusing subject, and I might have gotten a few things wrong myself,
so please add a comment and I’ll update it ASAP.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Coordinate systems</strong>
</p>
<p>
A coordinate system is simply put a way of describing a spatial property relative
to a center. There is more than one way of doing this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Geocentric coordinate system is based on a normal (X,Y,Z) coordinate system with
the origin at the center of Earth. This is the system that GPS uses internally for
doing it calculations, but since this is very unpractical to work with as a human
being ( due to the lack of well-known concepts of east, north, up, down) it is rarely
displayed to the user but converted to another coordinate system.<br>
<li>
The Spherical coordinate system is probably the most well-known. It is based on angles
relative to a prime meridian and Equator usually as Longitude and Latitude. Heights
are usually given relative to either the mean sea level or the datum (I’ll get back
to the datum later).<br>
<li>
The Cartesian coordinate system is defined as a “flat” coordinate system&nbsp;placed
on the surface of Earth.&nbsp; In some projections it’s not flat in the sense that
it&nbsp;follows the earth’s curvature in one direction and has a known scale-error
in the other direction relative to the distance of the origin. The most well-known
coordinate system is the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), but surveyors define
their own little local flat coordinate systems all the time. It is very easy to work
with,&nbsp;fairly accurate over small distances making measurements such as length,
angle and area very straightforward. Cartesian coordinate systems are strongly connected
to projections that I will cover later.</li>
</ul>
<p align=center>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Datums and ellipsoids</strong>
</p>
<p>
Some of the common properties of the above coordinate systems are that they are all
relative to the center of Earth and except the Geocentric coordinate system, uses
a height system relative to the surface of the earth.
</p>
<p>
This poses two immediate problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Where is the center of the earth 
<li>
What is the shape of the earth?</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img style="FLOAT: right" src="http://www.sharpgis.net/content/binary/Geoids_sm.jpg" border=0>By
now most people should know that that the earth isn’t flat (although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society">there
are still some who doubts it</a>). If we define the surface of Earth as being at the
mean sea level (often referred to as the Geoid), we don’t get a spheroid or even an
ellipsoid. Because of gravitational changes often caused by large masses such as mountain
ranges etc, Earth is actually very irregular with variations of +/- 100 meters. Since
this is not very practical to work with as a model of earth, we usually use an ellipsoid
for approximation. The ellipsoid is defined by its semi-major axis, and either the
flattening of the semi-minor axis.
</p>
<p>
The center and orientation of the ellipsoid is what we call the datum. So the datum
defines an ellipsoid and through the use of a set of points on the ground that we
relate to points on the ellipsoid, we define the center of the Earth.&nbsp; This poses
another problem, because continental drift moves the points used to define the points
around all the time. This is why the name of a datum usually have a year in it, often
referring to the position of those points January 1st of that year (although that
may vary).
</p>
<p>
There are a vast amount of datums, some used for measurements all over the world,
and other local datums defined so they fit very well with a local area. Some common
ones are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84">World Geodetic Datum 1984</a> (WGS84), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ED50">European
Datum 1950</a> (ED50) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAD83">North American
Datum 1983</a> (NAD83).
</p>
<p>
The most well-known is WGS84 used by the GPS systems today. It is a good approximation
of the entire world and fix-points defined almost all over the world. When it was
defined they forgot to include points in Europe though, so the Europeans now have
their own ETRS89, which is usually referred to as the “realization of WGS84 in Europe”.
The problem here was solely because of continental drift, so they defined some points
relative to WGS84 in 1989, and keeps track of the changes. In most use-cases it is
of no real importance and you can use one or the other.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned earlier that people often refer to having their data in WGS84, and you
see now why this doesn’t make sense. All you know from that is that the data is defined
using the WGS84 datum, but you don’t know which coordinate system it uses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Projections</strong>
</p>
<p>
The earth isn’t flat, and there is no simple way of putting it down on a flat paper
map (or these days a flat screen), so people have come up with all sorts of ingenious
solutions each with their pros and cons. Some preserves area, so all objects have
a relative size to each other, others preserve angles (conformal) like the Mercator
projection, some try to find a good intermediate mix with only little distortion on
several parameters etc. Common to them all is that they transform the world onto a
flat Cartesian coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
A common statement that I hear in GIS is the following “My map doesn’t have a projection”,
but this is simply not possible (unless you have a good old globe). Often people are
referring to data that is in longitude/latitude and displayed on a map without applying
any projection. What happens is that the system applies the simplest projection it
can: Mapping Longitude directly to X and Latitude to Y. This results in an equirectangular
projection, also called the “Plate Carree” projection. It results in very heavy distortion
making areas look squashed close to the poles. The “opposite” of the Plate Carree
is the Mercator projection which stretches areas close to the poles in the opposite
direction, making them look very big. This is the type of projection you see used
on <a href="http://maps.live.com">Live maps</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google

thinks, they do NOT use WGS84.
</p>
<p>

a datum using that ellipsoid, and either a geocentric, geographic or projection. The

Earlier today (some would say way too early after a long night at )
I attended the session "". This turned out to be more about
general patterns in Javascript and not so much about AJAX.

Anyway here are my notes from that session:

Avoid Eval(). Instead use parameterized code.

'Switch' is costly for large sets and grows linearly. Instead use a hashtable and
wrap in try/catch.

Getters/setters are inefficient. Use direct access to the variables in an instance.

DOM Instantiating and traversing is slow because it has to go from the JS layer to
the DOM layer through COM. Use it as little as possible. Example: 

   Bad: for(var i=0;i<100;i++) { document.getElementById('myDiv').innerHTML
= i; }
   Better: var div = document.getElementById('myDiv'); for(var i=0;i<100;i++)
{ div.innerHTML = i; }

Use speculative download. Try and anticipate what the user needs to download next.
For instance, on the login page start loading icons that the users will need after
logging in. The browser might as well spend the time he is spending on entering his
password on downloading stuff. When he then logs in the browser will retrieve the
images from the cache instead of having to download them from the server, making the
page load much quicker. Try going to the login page of an Outlook Webaccess website
and see what happens behind the scenes through .

Enable GZIP encoding on the webserver. Most browsers supports it and will result
in smaller downloads. Again  is great
for experimenting with this.

On my way back from the  I
was trying to get one of my WPF/E applications to run on the new  1.1alpha.
It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be because a lot seems to have changed. I
finally figured it out after reading Bryant Likes's blog. He already figured it out
and shared the solution (Thanks Bryant!):

If you want to go the "real" route of working with Silverlight 1.1alpha, here's what
you need:

I saw two really good sessions on Silverlight and .NET this morning. They are online
now, and I really recommend that you watch them:

One of the really neat things are that Silverlight also supports LINQ in the client
browser. Part 2 shows a cool example on that and how easy it makes it to work with
data. Furthermore you can easily communicate between Browser DOM, Javascript and .NET
assembly code which makes for some interesting scenarios. Since .NET excution is 400-1000
times faster than JavaScript, you could have your heavy algorithms inside silverlight,
and call them from Javascript. If you don't need the presentation-layer, you could
just hide it and have it as a library you utilize from JS.

So what is the main differences between v1.0 and v1.1? v1.1 contains:

Currently Silverlight works with Safari, Firefox and IE on both Mac and Windows and
soon to be Opera as well. I asked them whether they would also support other platforms
like Linux. Basically they didn't have any 'issues' with making that, but were currently
not considering it until there is a larger demand for it.

The big topic of  at the  was .
Today several new things were unveiled:

And to me the biggest news of them all:

Basically this means that you now can use C#, VB, IronPython, the all-new IronRuby
(also unveiled today) and any other .NET language in an app that runs inside the browser
crossbrowser AND crossplatform. Through .NET you can also work with and manipulate
the HTML DOM, use REST services etc. No more JavaScripting! (and I was just
about getting to a point where I really started to like JavaScript)

Scott Guthrie demoed  that used both JavaScript and C# for
the AI, and had the two languages “compete” against each other. According to Scott,
.NET is 400-1000 times faster than JavaScript, so it could calculate a lot more moves
in the same time. Of course .NET won the simulated game :-) There were a lot of other
cool Silverlight demos by non-Microsoft companies, including .

“Silverlight Streaming” ()
is Microsofts new website for sharing video (A Youtube killer perhaps?). You can freely
sign up for 4gb space, and supports up to DVD-quality videos of up to 10mins. You
can completely integrate videos streaming from Microsofts servers onto your webpage
through Silverlight. So the next time you upload a really cool video to your website
with the risk of overloading your server, Silverlight Streaming might be your answer.

So, Silverlight 1.0beta is out now, and will be finally released in the Summer 2007.
1.1alpha is out now too, but the final release is still to be determined. This includes
a subset of the .NET framework, similar to what they did to the compact framework.

They also showed that through Visual Studio Orcas you can now remotely debug Silverlight
applications that run on a Mac, set breakpoints, change properties on the fly etc.
REALLY cool stuff.

          
        
You can download Silverlight 1.0b, 1.1a and SDKs at 
So basically this means you now can use .NET for a larger array of purposes:

I can’t wait to get started with this!

The other sessions I attended today was pretty good too (although missing most of
the one I wanted the most because the hotel got my reservation screwed up), none of
it was really new stuff we haven’t seen before. Hopefully there will be some more
WOW tomorrow…

The big topic of <a href="http://visitmix.com/Blogs/Joshua/ray-ozzie-and-scott-guthrie-keynote/">today’s
keynote by Ray Ozzie &amp; Scott Guthrie</a> at the <a href="http://www.visitmix.com">Mix07</a> was <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>.
Today several new things were unveiled:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Silverlight 1.0 beta was released 
<li>
Silverlight 1.1 alpha was released / unveiled 
<li>
Silverlight Streaming was unveiled 
<li>
Silverlights new community website was unveiled at <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">www.silverlight.net</a> 
<li>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Expression/products/overview.aspx?key=blend">Blend
Expression</a> was released to day (we all got a free copy too)</li>
</ul>
<p>
And to me the biggest news of them all:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Silverlight 1.1 alpha has support for .NET code inside the Silverlight application!</li>
</ul>
<p>
Basically this means that you now can use C#, VB, IronPython, the all-new IronRuby
(also unveiled today) and any other .NET language in an app that runs inside the browser
crossbrowser AND crossplatform. Through .NET you can also work with and manipulate
the HTML DOM,&nbsp;use REST services etc.&nbsp;No more JavaScripting! (and I was just
about getting to a point where I really started to like JavaScript)
</p>
<p>
Scott Guthrie&nbsp;demoed <a href="http://silverlight.net/samples/1.1/chess/run/default.html">a
cool Silverlight-based chess application</a> that used both JavaScript and C# for
the AI, and had the two languages “compete” against each other. According to Scott,
.NET is 400-1000 times faster than JavaScript, so it could calculate a lot more moves
in the same time. Of course .NET won the simulated game :-) There were a lot of other
cool Silverlight demos by non-Microsoft companies, including <a href="http://www.metaliq.com/portfolio/silverlight.html">a
kick-ass video-editing&nbsp;app running in your browser</a>.
</p>
<p>
“Silverlight Streaming” (<a href="http://silverlight.live.com/">http://silverlight.live.com/</a>)
is Microsofts new website for sharing video (A Youtube killer perhaps?). You can freely
sign up for 4gb space, and supports up to DVD-quality videos of up to 10mins. You
can completely integrate videos streaming from Microsofts servers onto your webpage
through Silverlight. So the next time you upload a really cool video to your website
with the risk of overloading your server, Silverlight Streaming might be your answer.
</p>
<p>
So, Silverlight 1.0beta is out now, and will be finally released in the Summer 2007.
1.1alpha is out now too, but the final release is still to be determined. This includes
a subset of the .NET framework, similar to what they did to the compact framework.
</p>
<p>
They also showed that through Visual Studio Orcas you can now remotely debug Silverlight
applications that run on a Mac, set breakpoints, change properties on the fly etc.
REALLY cool stuff.
</p>
<p align=center>
<em>Hi I’m a Mac. Hi I’m a PC and I can control you remotely! ;-)</em>
</p>
<p>
You can download Silverlight 1.0b, 1.1a and SDKs at <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/silverlight/default.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/silverlight/default.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
So basically this means you now can use .NET for a larger array of purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
ASP.NET (Webserver) 
<li>
XNA (XBOX) 
<li>
CF.NET (Pocket PC/Phone) 
<li>
Silverlight (Webclient – Crossplatform!) 
<li>
WPF (Desktop)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I can’t wait to get started with this!
</p>
<p>
The other sessions I attended today was pretty good too (although missing most of
the one I wanted the most because the hotel got my reservation screwed up), none of
it was really new stuff we haven’t seen before. Hopefully there will be some more
WOW tomorrow…

          Something
I've noticed during my time here in the US, is the way companies pick on each other
in the ads. It's like they are more busy talking about their competitors than themselves.
I do find that pretty strange, and it definitely doesn't work on me. At least there
are companies who have a policy of not mentioning competitors, which makes a lot more
sense to me. Why would you even want to tell your customers that there are alternatives
to your product? As a  once said: "Even bad publicity is good publicity"

Apple currently makes a lot of the "Hello I'm a Mac, and I'm a PC" ads which falls
in this "pick on your competitor" category, and it's not the first time they are doing
these kind of ads. OK, I must admit that  is pretty funny, but what it is really that a Mac does? After
watching several Mac commercials, I've come to the following conclusion: A Mac is
an absolute waste of money, Apple suffers from a bad case of self-esteem and tries
to make up for it by patronizing Microsoft. It’s a bit like the bullies back in the
school yard who never got anywhere in life.

This is how I came to my conclusion (before you start yelling at me, I might be wrong
but this is what sprang to my mind when I watched the ads):

OK I'm not really a Mac fan, and I'm probably the only one in the whole wide
World who thinks that the white Mac and Ipod design is just plain ugly, and should
be sent back to the 70s.

I've noticed during my time here in the US, is the way companies pick on each other
in the ads. It's like they are more busy talking about their competitors than themselves.
I do find that pretty strange, and it definitely doesn't work on me. At least there
are companies who have a policy of not mentioning competitors, which makes a lot more
sense to me. Why would you even want to tell your customers that there are alternatives
to your product? As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Spies">famous former

<p>
Apple currently makes a lot of the "Hello I'm a Mac, and I'm a PC" ads which falls
in this "pick on your competitor" category, and it's not the first time they are doing
these kind of ads. OK, I must admit that <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/">the
one about security</a> is pretty funny, but what it is really that a Mac does? After
watching several Mac commercials, I've come to the following conclusion: A Mac is
an absolute waste of money, Apple suffers from a bad case of self-esteem and tries
to make up for it by patronizing Microsoft. It’s a bit like the bullies back in the
school yard who never got anywhere in life.
</p>
<p>
This is how I came to my conclusion (before you start yelling at me, I might be wrong
but this is what sprang to my mind when I watched the ads):

<li>
<strong>Windows Security ad</strong>: Apparently Mac haven't implemented any security
that will bug you, or prevent you from doing something stupid without thinking twice. 
<li>
<strong>Surgery ad</strong>: So you can't change the hardware of a Mac and upgrade

OK&nbsp;I'm not really a Mac fan, and I'm probably the only one in the whole wide

be&nbsp;sent back&nbsp;to the 70s.

Everytime I'm sitting down with a freshly installed PC, there is always one application
I install before everything else (yeah even before antivirus software!): .
It's my #1 application for navigating around the file system, running commands, opening/editing/zipping/unzipping/uploading/searching/multi-renaming
files etc. etc. I use it so much that just using Windows Explorer to navigate to the
install of TotalCommander is several agonizing seconds while thinking "God I wish
I had TotalCmd to install TotalCmd" :-)

Today the first beta of the all new version 7 was released. Yepppiiiiiiii If you are
new to TotalCmd, it's a great tool for quickly doing what else would require slow
mouse navigation in Explorer and installing a bunch of additional applications.
There's even a great set of plug-ins to make it even better! Below is a screenshot
of TotalCmd configured as I like it. 
          : It's shareware and only $34, and you can install it
on all your computers (as long as you only use one at a time, which most non-squid
people do).

          : In the install folder, there's a file called 'KEYBOARD.TXT'.
This contains a list of keyboard shortcuts that will make your use of TotalCmd much
more efficient, and discover a lot more of it's potential. I try to go through it
once a month, and usually I learn some new ones everytime.

I just had my first day at ESRI today, where I have joined the ArcGIS Server .NET
ADF team.

Everything here seemed well-prepared and set-up when I got there, including a
small "seminar" for everyone who started as ESRI today, and ready-installed desktop
and laptop computers.

I already got to look "under the hood" of AGS and play around with it -
there's definitely some very cool stuff in there! Hopefully I'll get some time to

Yesterday I went on my very first "road-trip" in USA, driving from Redlands up to
San Luis Obispo to visit a friend of mine, a 5-6 hours drive. Of course I brought
my TomTom  navigator to help out (since I had more or less no idea how to get
up there), and already after 10 miles of driving it got handy, when the whole I-10
freeway closed, probably because of yet another accident. TomTom has a neat little
feature to avoid roadblocks or entire parts of the trip, and provide you with an alternative.

I wasn’t  too sure how up-to-date the map was, but thought I would let it guide
me on a round trip. Well it turned out that the maps were a little too up-to-date,
when it suddenly wanted me to enter an only half  completed freeway :-). Good
thing I brought my paper-maps as well, although they are far harder to use while driving
;-)

Recently the Virtual Earth team  . One of the new features allowed to overlay the
maps with tiles from your own tile-server. The tile-server can be added using a few
lines of javascript like this: 

This will add a new tile layer named "POPDENS" to the virtual earth map, and make
it slightly transparent. The GetTilePath parameter refers to the JavaScript method
that creates the request-url to the server. Ex: 

The X, Y and ZoomLevel parameters in this querystring are unfortunately not simple
coordinates, but are the row/column of the tile at the current zoom level. has earlier on how to convert these to longitude/latitude values. 

The next step is to create the tile-server. I used for
this. SharpMap's on-the-fly transformation capability is needed to transform the data
to the Mercator projection that Virtual Earth uses, but any map-renderer
that can project data could be used. You could also create a javascript
that makes the GetTilePath method return a WMS request instead and then use any of
the many WMS servers available. 

The basic trick is to use Rob Blackwell's methods for calculating the longitude/latitude of
each tile's corners, transform these coordinates to the Mercator projection and
render the resulting extent.

map here:

Call me arrogant it you want, but you have probably seen some of this yourself. People
sometimes seem exceptionally lazy when asking for help in a developer forum.

Here are some of the questions I often see in developer forums and that are rarely
answered.

          
          
…if this is all you ask, how would you ever expect us to be able to help you?

          
          
Do you really expect someone volunteer to set up a project, do what ever it takes
to have your code run in our setup, fix it and send it back to you ready to implement
in your project? Showing a bit of initiative, writing what this code does, where the
error is, showing that you actually have been doing some debugging etc. always helps.
Lots of code comments also help us understand your code without spending a lot of
time analyzing it.

          
          
Ehm yeah so? Please state what you were trying to do, perhaps showing some previous
lines of code, write WHAT error you received and preferably a full stack trace.

          
          
Most developer forums are for helping out – not for doing YOUR job.

          
          
Did you ever wonder what the button "Create new thread" is for? ()

          
          
This tends annoy most people. Annoyed people tend not to be so helpful. Just because
you haven’t received a reply within the last hour, it rarely helps asking over and
over.

          
          
Showing that you have actually tried working with your problem, that you have read
the documentation and browsed the demos usually helps a lot to get people interested
in helping you.

          
          
How should we know what you are referring to? ()

          
          
If you want people to read your post (and preferable someone who knows something about
this), make sure the topic makes sense in relation to your question. It will also
help people find your question later, when they run into the same problem. Topics
like "Can I do this?" or "Problem" is not very appealing posts to read.

I have received a lot of questions on how to transform data from one coordinatesystem
to another on the fly in . Usually
the problem is that they have data in different coordinatesystems and want to match
them. Although I would recommend applying transformations once-and-for-all to increase
performance (you could use for this), it
is easy to setup in . Below are some
examples on how to accomplish this.

           gives you the full power to specify
all the parameters in a projection. The following method demonstrates how to setup
a UTM projection:

If you have a well-known text-representation, you can also create a projection from
this. A WKT for an UTM projection might look like this:

PROJCS["WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N",GEOGCS["WGS 84",DATUM["WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],UNIT["degree",0.01745329251994328,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["metre",1,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","32632"]]

SharpMap comes with WKT parsers for parsing a WKT to a coordinate system (note: the
current v0.9RC1 has a few bug in its WKT parser, but if you get problems parsing the
WKT, use the current source from the repository, where these issues have
been resolved)

If your data is based on shapefile data and they have a .prj file defining
the coordinatesystem, you can simply retrieve the CS from the shapefile
instead:

The next step is to create a transformation between two coordinate systems. SharpMap
currently supports transforming between a geographic coordinate system and one of
the following projections:

Unfortunately datum-shifts and transformations between two projections are still down
the pipeline, but the above will be sufficient in most cases. (for those interested
full transformation between all supported projections as well as datum-shifts are
almost done...)

The following shows how to create a transformation and apply it to a vectorlayer (only
vector- and label-layers supports on-the-fly transformations):

Happy transforming!

the problem is that they have data in different coordinatesystems and want to match
them. Although I would recommend applying transformations once-and-for-all to increase
performance (you could use <a href="http://ogr.maptools.org/">OGR </a>for this), it

} </pre>
<p>
If you have a well-known text-representation, you can also create a projection from
this. A WKT for an UTM projection might look like this:
</p>
<p>
PROJCS["WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N",GEOGCS["WGS 84",DATUM["WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],UNIT["degree",0.01745329251994328,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",9],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["metre",1,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","32632"]]
</p>
<p>
SharpMap comes with WKT parsers for parsing a WKT to a coordinate system (note: the
current v0.9RC1 has a few bug in its WKT parser, but if you get problems parsing the
WKT, use the current source from the repository,&nbsp;where&nbsp;these issues have
been resolved)

cFac = <span class=kwrd>new</span> CoordinateSystemFactory(); <span class=kwrd>return</span> cFac.CreateFromWkt(strProj);
}</pre>
<p>
If your data is based on shapefile data&nbsp;and they have&nbsp;a .prj file defining
the coordinatesystem, you can simply retrieve&nbsp;the&nbsp;CS&nbsp;from the shapefile
instead:
</p>
<pre class=csharpcode>((myMap.Layers[0] <span class=kwrd>as</span> VectorLayer).DataSource <span class=kwrd>as</span> ShapeFile).CoordinateSystem</pre>
<p>
The next step is to create&nbsp;a transformation between two coordinate systems. SharpMap
currently supports transforming between a geographic coordinate system and one of
the following projections:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mercator 1-standard parallel (Mercator_1SP) 
<li>
Mercator 1-standard parallels (Mercator_2SP) 
<li>
Transverse mercator (Transverse_Mercator) 
<li>
Lambert Conic Conformal 2-standard parallel (Lambert Conic Conformal (2SP)) 
<li>
Albers</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately datum-shifts and transformations between two projections are still down
the pipeline, but the above will be sufficient in most cases. (for those interested
full transformation between all supported projections as well as&nbsp;datum-shifts&nbsp;are
almost done...)
</p>
<p>
The following shows how to create a transformation and apply it to a vectorlayer (only
vector- and label-layers supports on-the-fly transformations):
</p>
<pre class=csharpcode><span class=rem>//Create zone UTM 32N projection</span> IProjectedCoordinateSystem
utmProj = CreateUtmProjection(32); <span class=rem>//Create geographic coordinate
system (lets just reuse the CS from the projection)</span> IGeographicCoordinateSystem
geoCS = utmProj.GeographicCoordinateSystem; <span class=rem>//Create transformation</span> CoordinateTransformationFactory
ctFac = <span class=kwrd>new</span> CoordinateTransformationFactory(); ICoordinateTransformation
transform = 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ctFac.CreateFromCoordinateSystems(source, target); <span class=rem>//Apply
transformation to a vectorlayer</span> (myMap.Layers[0] <span class=kwrd>as</span> VectorLayer).CoordinateTransformation

<p>
Happy transforming!

The GML standard is a big and complex standard, and I really think this is a

include the annex), and it's nothing compared to the 267 (601) pages full GML
spec.

Hopefully we'll see more GML support in the future. At least this finally got me started
with implementing GML/WFS support into .

I just read this days newsletter from <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC</a>,
containing <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/press/?page=pressrelease&amp;year=0&amp;prid=260">some
news</a> on the release of a <a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=15201">simple
profile of the GML v3.1.1 standard</a>. From the standard one can read the following
in the introduction:
</p>
<p>
<em>This profile defines a restricted but useful subset of XML-Schema and GML to lower
the “implementation bar” of time and resources required for an organization to commit
for developing software that supports GML. [...] this profile facilitates the ability
to use WFS for interoperable feature data exchange with much less software development
investment.</em>
</p>
<p>
The GML standard is a&nbsp;big and complex standard, and I really think this is a
great move by the OGC. This is a&nbsp;30 page long specification (well 117 if you
include the annex), and&nbsp;it's nothing compared to the 267 (601) pages full GML
spec.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully we'll see more GML support in the future. At least this finally got me started
with&nbsp;implementing GML/WFS support into <a href="http://sharpmap.iter.dk">SharpMap</a>.
</p>
<p>
Well, while I'm at it, if you want to know more on the GML specification, I can recommend
the book "<a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470871547.html">Geography
Markup Language, Foundation for the Geo-Web</a>" by Ron Lake from <a href="http://www.wiley.com">Wiley</a>.
