<p>The new Yahoo! mobile app is also smarter, using Summly’s natural-language algorithms and machine learning to deliver quick story summaries. We acquired Summly less than a month ago, and we’re thrilled to introduce this game-changing technology in our first mobile application. And, with the immersive imagery of our virtually endless newsfeed, the new Yahoo! app has both great technology and beautiful design front and center. Because searching for great content is also core to the Yahoo! experience, we’ve also improved the search experience with better video and image search.</p>

BOSS team is thrilled to announce BOSS Geo, new additions to our Search API that’s designed to help foster innovation in the search industry. BOSS Geo, comprised of two popular services – PlaceFinder and PlaceSpotter – now offers powerful, new geo services to BOSS developers.</p>
<p>Geo is increasingly important in today’s always-on, mobile world and adding features like these have been among the most requested we’ve received from our developers. With mobile devices becoming more pervasive, users everywhere want to be able to quickly pull up relevant geo information like maps or addresses. By adding PlaceFinder and PlaceSpotter to BOSS, we’re arming developers with rich new tools for driving more valuable and personalized interactions with their users.</p>
<p><strong>PlaceFinder – Geocoding made simple</strong><br />
PlaceFinder is a geocoder (and reverse geocoder) service. The service helps developers convert an address into a latitude/longitude and alternatively, if you provide a latitude/longitude it can resolve it to an address. Whether you are building a check-in service or want to show an address on a map, we’ve got you covered.  PlaceFinder already powers several popular applications like foursquare. which uses it to power check-ins on their mobile application. <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/#placefinder">BOSS PlaceFinder</a> offers tiered pricing and one simple monthly bill.</p>

<p><strong>PlaceSpotter – Adding location awareness to your content</strong><br />
The PlaceSpotter API (formerly known as PlaceMaker) allows developers to take a piece of content, pull rich information about the locations mentioned and provide meaning to those locations. A news article is no longer just text but has rich, meaningful geographical information associated with it. For instance, the next time your users are reading a review of a cool new coffee shop in the Mission neighborhood in San Francisco, they can discover another article about a hip new bakery in the same neighborhood. Learn more on the new <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/#placespotter">PlaceSpotter</a> service.</p>
<p><strong>Using the new services</strong><br />
If you are a current BOSS developer, you are all set to go. Simply review the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/docs/">documentation</a> and start using the service with your existing key. If you are a new developer, you can <a href="https://developer.apps.yahoo.com/dashboard/createKey.html">sign up for BOSS</a> by creating a key, and adding a payment option like a credit card or PayPal.</p>
<p><strong>YQL tables for development</strong><br />
If you are looking to continue experimenting with the standalone PlaceFinder and PlaceMaker services, we are excited to continue supporting you through our YQL tables. These <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20geo.placefinder%20where%20text%3D%22sfo%22">tables</a> will be limited to 2,000 queries per day and are meant for non-commercial usage. We intend to shut down the current free versions of PlaceFinder and PlaceMaker on <strong>November 17, 2012.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BOSS, today</strong><br />
We started BOSS to provide developers access to search technology, something that is tremendously hard to do well. We are now taking the same model and extending it to other technologies.Because of the flexibility of the BOSS model, it’s used by a wide variety of institutions – everyone from non-profits, to Fortune 500 companies to small business owners. Today, BOSS powers tens of millions of queries for thousands of developer applications.</p>
<p>Thanks to all our developers out there who continue to inspire us with the amazing things they’re doing with BOSS everyday. And, don’t be shy—let us know what you’d like to see more of from us!</p>

<p>But, we’re most excited about all the comments, questions and feature ideas that we got from you all – our users. Last night, we rolled out an update to Yahoo! Axis on the desktop and iOS that now offers enhanced performance and the most frequently requested user features.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Browser Plug-in Updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Close Option:</strong> Now, you can close Axis with a simple click on any web page so that it never interferes with your browsing experience.  By clicking on the ‘X,’ Axis will disappear on the page.  To make Axis visible again, simply reload the page or navigate to a new page.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New features for Yahoo! Axis iOS include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening links in new tabs:</strong> Many of you wanted to be able to open a web link in a new tab. Now, whenever you press down on a link, Axis gives you the option of opening the link in your current tab, in a new tab or simply copying the link.  Navigating web sites just got a lot smoother in Axis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Private Browsing Mode:</strong> Yahoo! Axis now offers a more robust private browsing mode on iPhone and iPad.  When activated, Axis will not store cookies or web site browsing so you can keep your Axis experiences private.  With private browsing mode, you also have the option to keep all your tabs open or close all tabs when you enter or exit the mode. Bookmarks created during &#8216;Private Browsing Mode&#8217; will be preserved and will be shown along with the regular bookmarks, across all devices.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secured Site Lock:</strong> Easily identify secured web sites before entering in personal information, such as login or credit card information.  With the new lock graphic, which is displayed in the Axis title bar on secured web sites, you’ll be able to more easily keep your information safe and share it only with trusted sites.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Axis data, such as search history, browsing history and bookmarks, is now encrypted locally to keep you and your personal information even more secure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we’re always focused on ensuring that Axis performs quickly and seamlessly so we’ve released several enhancements to improve the overall performance across iOS and desktop. Check out the new <a href="http://axis.yahoo.com/">version</a> of Axis today and let us know what you think!</p>
