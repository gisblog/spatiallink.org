don't have any attachment to Virginia Tech. I did take three graduate

So I think the answer to my question is yes: being a parent just makes
you look at things differently. You replace every face of those dead
students with your child's. You start imagining how awful it would be
if it was your child who was shot. There's also the fact that the
shooter went to the high school down the street from work (right next
to the pool I take Danny to every Sunday), that he lived basically in
the same community and that at least 2 other kids from that same high
school died. I should also mention that the 18-year-old who shot 2
police officers last year at the <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/shooting.html">police</a> <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/shooting_update.html">station</a>
by work also attended that high school. It's just such a peaceful area
around here, it's difficult to understand why people would do this.</p>

<p>
By all accounts, this kid was a loner and did not integrate well. I feel
very bad for this kid's parents. How awful must it be to lose your
child and to know that he is responsible for the deaths of 32
other human beings? How do you go on living life in that case? Will you always blame yourself? Does it get better over time? I also
wonder whether him moving to the US at age 8 had any impact on him. Was
the language/cultural difference too much for him? Or was he just a kid
with poor social skills who internalized everything? I guess we'll
probably never know.</p>

<p>
All I could think of yesterday at work was that I wanted to go home and hug the kids. I've learned these past couple of years to enjoy and cherish every moment in life (I'm still working on that) and this is certainly a good reminder to do so. I don't want to sound preachy, but hug your family tonight.

My flight was supposed to leave at 2:43PM from Palm Springs. I was going through Denver to go back to Virginia (Dulles airport). Our plane was late arriving, but noone manned the ticket counter or changed the information until about 2:55PM. We eventually boarded the plane, only to find out, probably about 10 minutes after we were all on board, that they hadn't refueled the plane enough and we needed more fuel for the trip. We waited for a while until the fuel truck came and eventually started taxiing to the runway. Fast-forward about 1 hour. We're on the runway, neither the pilot nor the flight attendants said anything (the latter were just chit-chatting in the back). The pilot finally came on the intercom to tell us that the winds had shifted and we needed to take off from the other end of the runway. Fast-forward about another 30 minutes. We're still on the ground and as far as I know, there's no line of plane in front of us. The pilot comes on and tells us there's a problem with the AC and we need to go back to the gate to get it fixed. At that point, they told us we could use our cell phones. I asked one of the flight attendants whether we should do anything to get new flights since I was more likely than not going to miss my connection in Denver (which, by the way, was delayed a couple of hours). I was told I wouldn't have to, that there's an automated system that will do that. Uh-huh... In the next 30 minutes, I called United reservations twice to find out what my next flight was going to be. Both agents thought I was in Denver, even though I was stuck in Palm Springs on a UA plane. The next flight out of Denver I could get on would be the next day around 1PM. People started getting pissed on the plane as most of us were missing our connections and were finding out we'd get stuck in Denver overnight. I started looking in the Hemispheres magazine at the paths United flies over the continental US, and they fly from Palm Springs to LAX, then LAX to Dulles. I thought I might have a chance flying through LAX. So I called United reservations again. Turns out, yes, I can catch a 8PM flight to LAX from Palm Springs then the red-eye from LAX to IAD. I'd be home around 6AM. That sounded good to me, so I checked whether I could get off the plane. The flight attendant told me to check with the agent. I got off the plane (we were at the gate, but only the people in the front of the airplane knew we could get off if we wanted to, I had no idea). So I get off the plane and get a bad look from the gate agent. I finally tell him I want to get on the LAX flight and need my luggage taken off the plane. He booked me on the LAX flight but my luggage would stay on the plane (I got it in Dulles, so all was well on that front). I made it home via LAX. I wouldn't have via Denver: my flight arrived over 30 minutes after my Denver - IAD flight left. Another woman on the plane going to IAD heard my story through someone else (she was a bit distraught) and made it on the same flights as me. I should also mention that some people left the plane to go buy some food or drinks, but never were told when the plane was leaving. It'd be very easy for the gate agent to just pick up the intercom and communicate with passengers in the airport. One gentleman barely made it back.<br />I've just now spent about 40 minutes waiting for a United agent to book a flight for the family this September. First I waited for a reservations person for 10 minutes only to be sent to a ringing phone. I let it ring about 30 times then hung up. The second time around, I waited about 30 minutes until I spoke to someone. All of this to add an infant on a lap since you can't do that online.

But as I was laying awake in bed last night trying to fall asleep as it was thundering outside for two (!) hours, I figured that continuing the ArcObjects lessons might be useful. Since I'm now mostly programming in VB.NET, I'm first going to introduce you to the changes to expect. I think I'll go over creating a new tool in .NET today, then cover certain things that you might now be aware of when programming ArcObjects with .NET in the next lesson.</p>
<p><strong><u>Getting Set Up</u></strong></p>
<p>ArcGIS Desktop 9.1 was designed to work with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003. You can program with 2002 (I've done it), but to be honest, if you can, move to 2003. I don't know about using Visual Studio .NET 2005 &amp; ArcGIS Desktop 9.1, but I'm sure the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/forums.asp?c=93">forums</a> could provide some information.</p>
<p>Some of the issues I had with 2002 were to get the help and ESRI add-ins to show up. The forums provided the information I needed though for the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&amp;f=1170&amp;t=102801&amp;mc=17#msgid297917">Help</a> and the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&amp;f=1170&amp;t=151340&amp;mc=8#518456">add-ins</a>. Also see my <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/01/upgraded_to_91.html">previous</a> <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/01/getting_into_it.html">posts</a> about these problems.</p>
<p>Make sure the ArcObjects help shows up in your VS help, as well as loading all the add-ins if they aren't already. I like using the external ArcObjects Help (Start Menu - Programs - ArcGIS - Developer Help - .NET Help) because it shows more information than the help that shows up inside VS. I really only use one of the add-ins: ESRI ComponentCategoryRegistrar.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/06/bad_week_end_in.html">learned</a> during the ArcGIS Server class I took a couple of weeks ago that ArcGIS Desktop 9.2 is designed to work with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005. I don't know if you'll be able to program with 2003 with it. I'm assuming it'll be possible, but I'm definitely upgrading VS at the same time as I'm upgrading ArcGIS.</p>
<p><strong><u>Creating a New VS Project</u></strong></p>
<p>I <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/01/getting_into_it.html">started out</a> by following <a href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.1/default.asp?url=/arcobjects/9.1/ArcGISDevHelp/DevelopmentEnvs/DotNet/Walkthrough1VB.htm">&quot;Walkthrough 1 VB.NET: Creating a simple command for ArcMap&quot;</a>. It was useful to get some basic getting-started information. However, you'll get the highlights in this lesson</p>
<p>To create a new VS project and create your first tool, follow these steps:<br />
</p>

<ol>
	<li>To create a new project, open up VS, and select &quot;Class Library&quot; from the &quot;Visual basic Projects&quot; project types.</li>
	<li>In the Solution Explorer, right-click on Class1.vb, and delete it.</li>
	<li>Right-click on your project name and select &quot;Add&quot; - &quot;Add new item&quot;.</li>
	<li>Select &quot;COM class&quot;, give it a name, and click &quot;Open&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have a project, and a blank COM class. The first thing you need to do now, is load up a minimum of ESRI references. Load the following references by right-clicking on the References folder in the Solution Explorer, and selecting &quot;Add reference&quot; (select these from the .NET tab, not the COM tab):<br />
</p>

<ol>
	<li>ESRI.ArcGIS.ArcMapUI</li>
	<li>ESRI.ArcGIS.Carto</li>
	<li>ESRI.ArcGIS.Framework</li>
	<li>ESRI.ArcGIS.Geometry</li>
	<li>ESRI.ArcGIS.SystemUI</li>
	<li>System.Drawing</li>
</ol>
<p>This is really the bare minimum you'll need. You'll be adding more as you program. Once you've added these references, you'll need to import namespaces. You should type the following lines of code at the very top of your COM class.</p>
<p>Imports ESRI.ArcGIS.ArcMapUI<br />
Imports ESRI.ArcGIS.Carto<br />
Imports ESRI.ArcGIS.Framework<br />
Imports ESRI.ArcGIS.Geometry<br />
Imports ESRI.ArcGIS.SystemUI</p>
<p>Now that you have all of the necessary references to create a new command, you can actually implement it. This works a little differently than in VB6 (and than VS 2002). Just type &quot;Implements ICommand&quot; below the &quot;Public Class&quot; line of code and hit Enter. This will add in all the required properties and subs for ICommand. Pretty sweet, huh?</p>
<p>Ok, this is actually pretty long already, so I'll continue this next time (probably next week). I got some work to do!</p>";}s:2:"dc";a:3:{s:7:"subject";s:3:"GIS";s:7:"creator";s:17:"Marianne Cardwell";s:4:"date";s:25:"2006-06-23T11:10:21-04:00";}s:7:"summary";s:200:"I've been really out of ideas of things to post lately (hence the lack of posts).

But as I was laying awake in bed last night trying to fall asleep as it was thundering outside for two (!) hours, I figured that continuing the ArcObjects lessons might be useful. Since I'm now mostly programming in VB.NET, I'm first going to introduce you to the changes to expect. I think I'll go over creating a new tool in .NET today, then cover certain things that you might now be aware of when programming ArcObjects with .NET in the next lesson.</p>
<p><strong><u>Getting Set Up</u></strong></p>
<p>ArcGIS Desktop 9.1 was designed to work with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003. You can program with 2002 (I've done it), but to be honest, if you can, move to 2003. I don't know about using Visual Studio .NET 2005 &amp; ArcGIS Desktop 9.1, but I'm sure the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/forums.asp?c=93">forums</a> could provide some information.</p>
<p>Some of the issues I had with 2002 were to get the help and ESRI add-ins to show up. The forums provided the information I needed though for the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&amp;f=1170&amp;t=102801&amp;mc=17#msgid297917">Help</a> and the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&amp;f=1170&amp;t=151340&amp;mc=8#518456">add-ins</a>. Also see my <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/01/upgraded_to_91.html">previous</a> <a href="http://gis.typepad.com/blog/2006/01/getting_into_it.html">posts</a> about these problems.</p>
<p>Make sure the ArcObjects help shows up in your VS help, as well as loading all the add-ins if they aren't already. I like using the external ArcObjects Help (Start Menu - Programs - ArcGIS - Developer Help - .NET Help) because it shows more information than the help that shows up inside VS. I really only use one of the add-ins: ESRI ComponentCategoryRegistrar.</p>
