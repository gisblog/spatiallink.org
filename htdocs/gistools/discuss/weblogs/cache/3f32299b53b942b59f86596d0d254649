This directory contains one of the three versions of the 2004 Blue Marble Next Generation sets of data.

These are MODIS satellite derived images, one for each month in 2004.

The different directories are:

world				- base images
world-with-topo		- enhanced with topography
world-with-topo-bathy	- enhanced with topography and bathymetry

Unless you need the base images for landuse classification, you will probably find the images in world-with-topo-bathy of most use (it has the best looking images).

If you just need a single image, try the world-topo-bathy-200406-3x86400x43200.ecw image in the world-with-topo-bathy directory, as this has the least snow cover.

NOTE: two images (world-topo-bathy-200405-3x86400x43200.ecw and world-topo-bathy-200405-3x86400x43200.ecw) are missing due to errors in the original GZIPED files. We are trying to get hold of good copies from NASA and will update the directories once done.

Images are stored in the ECW image format, one per month for the year.  The original images were each 10GB in size.  The ECW images are about 200MB in size (about 50 times smaller than the original images).  A target compression rate of 5:1 was selected for compression, however due to the low level of information content in the images the ECW compression was able to achieve an actual compression rate of 50:1 (ECW uses fixed quality compression, so actual compression rate can be different from target compression rate.  An ECW compression rate of 5:1 as used here is of higher quality than JPEG compression).   ER Mapper 7.0 was used to create the compressed images, reducing the total size for all image from 345GB to 7GB.  See http://www.ermapper.com for more details on the ECW image format and ER Mapper.

Most GIS and CAD products can directly read ECW images.  Free plugins and free viewers are also available from http://www.ermapper.com/downloads.

Please note that the images are reasonably large (86,400 pixels across).  Some of the ECW plugins, such as for PhotoShop, allow you to read a reduced resolution version of the image that is small enough for limited applications to handle.

The images are in the WGS84/GEODETIC map projection, with each pixel being 0.004166666666666 degrees in size (about 500 meters per pixel at the equator).

Credits are as follows (from NASA):

For all non-private uses, the terms of use are as follows:
  1) The imagery is free of licensing fees
  2) NASA requires that they be provided a credit as the owners of the
     imagery

Beyond that, we request that you provide, if possible, a credit

0.7TB of images compressed to 90GB

This is a greyscale 1 meter mosaic of DOQQ airphotos for all of California, projected into the standard WGS84/GEODETIC map projection.

Source data is from CASIL DOQQ downloads (casil-mirror1.ceres.ca.gov/casil/), using the latest DOQQs available (most produces in 2004 - see CASIL for details on individual DOQQ files).

Source data was about 800GB, which has been compressed at 8:1 to a single 90GB mosaic covering all of California at 0.000001 degrees per pixel (about 1 meter per pixel).

Roughly 12,000 individual DOQQ images were reprojected from two different state plane projections into the geodetic projection.  Each DOQQ was colorbalanced using ER Mapper and the 12,000 indivitual DOQQ images mosiaced into this single ECW file at 8:1 compression ratio again using ER Mapper.

To give a pleasing looking image when zoomed out to all of California, the mosaic was slightly enhanced with a light enhancement using Landsat covering the entire state. This means that the mosaic shows good structure going from zoomed from the entire state down to individual streets.

The CA topographic mosaic for all of California, available at:

world-with-topo-bathy	- enhanced with topography and bathymetry

Unless you need the base images for landuse classification, you will probably find the images in world-with-topo-bathy of most use (it has the best looking images).

If you just need a single image, try the world-topo-bathy-200406-3x86400x43200.ecw image in the world-with-topo-bathy directory, as this has the least snow cover.

NOTE: two images (world-topo-bathy-200405-3x86400x43200.ecw and world-topo-bathy-200405-3x86400x43200.ecw) are missing due to errors in the original GZIPED files. We are trying to get hold of good copies from NASA and will update the directories once done.

Images are stored in the ECW image format, one per month for the year.  The original images were each 10GB in size.  The ECW images are about 200MB in size (about 50 times smaller than the original images).  A target compression rate of 5:1 was selected for compression, however due to the low level of information content in the images the ECW compression was able to achieve an actual compression rate of 50:1 (ECW uses fixed quality compression, so actual compression rate can be different from target compression rate).   ER Mapper 7.0 was used to create the compressed images.

Most GIS and CAD products can directly read ECW images.  Free plugins and free viewers are also available from http://www.ermapper.com/downloads.

Please note that the images are reasonably large (86,400 pixels across).  Some of the ECW plugins, such as for PhotoShop, allow you to read a reduced resolution version of the image that is small enough for limited applications to handle.

The images are in the WGS84/GEODETIC map projection, with each pixel being 0.004166666666666 degrees in size (about 500 meters per pixel at the equator).

Credits are as follows (from NASA):

For all non-private uses, the terms of use are as follows:
  1) The imagery is free of licensing fees
  2) NASA requires that they be provided a credit as the owners of the
     imagery

Beyond that, we request that you provide, if possible, a credit 
  for the Earth Observatory team for developing the imagery,
  and include a URL (http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) if feasible.

This directory contains one of the three versions of the 2004 Blue Marble Next Generation sets of data.

These are MODIS satellite derived images, one for each month in 2004.

The different directories are:

world			- base images
world-with-topo		- enhanced with topography
world-with-topo-bathy	- enhanced with topography and bathymetry
