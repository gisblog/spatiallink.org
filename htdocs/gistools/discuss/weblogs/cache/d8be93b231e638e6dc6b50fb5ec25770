<p>February 4th, 2007 was the first anniversary of OSGeo.  One year ago 25 people met face-to-face, and many more via phone and IRC, to discuss the possibility of starting an umbrella organisation.  These participants represented over 13 different open source projects.  The foundational purpose of the organisation was to help promote and continue to develop open source tools in the geospatial sphere.  Since that time, much has happened and momentum around OSGeo continues to develop.  Here are only a few highlights from that first year.</p>


<h2 id="toc0">Members Added</h2>
<p>The initial 25 charter members were expanded to a full 45  <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/content/foundation/members/voting_members.html">voting members</a> after a public nomination process.  These are the members who are responsible for voting in the Board.  Regular members were also invited to join at no cost and without any formal process.  The development of a membership management application is currently underway, which will allow members to formally sign up.</p>


<h2 id="toc1">Committees Established</h2>
 Several committees are overseeing day-to-day work and special projects: <ul>
    <li> A <strong>Board of Directors</strong> was created early on and expanded to include 9 representatives from around the world.  The Board has been very active in setting direction, policies and helping in general.</li>
    <li> <strong>Website</strong> and <strong>Systems Administration</strong> committees - focused on website content and  infrastructure maintenance and development</li>
    <li> Project <strong>Incubation</strong> - monitoring and guiding projects through the incubation process</li>
    <li> <strong>Promotion and Visibility</strong> - developing promotional material, coordinating OSGeo presence at conferences, creating press releases</li>
    <li> <strong>Conference</strong> planning - helping organise the annual OSGeo <a href="http://foss4g2007.org">FOSS4G</a> conference event</li>
    <li> <strong>Fundraising</strong> - raising funds to cover day-to-day costs of the foundation and its projects</li>
    <li> <strong>Public Geospatial Data</strong> - working towards making more data publicly available and building tools for finding it</li>
    <li> <strong>Education/Curriculum</strong> development - working towards a set of teaching tools for bringing open source into the academic mapping and GIS environment</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="toc2">Projects Joining</h2>
 The primary goal of OSGeo is to help further develop and promote particular software projects.  An initial set of projects joined the <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/incubator">incubation</a> process at the beginning and since then a couple have graduated and a few more have joined.  Even more are waiting for approval to join the process.
