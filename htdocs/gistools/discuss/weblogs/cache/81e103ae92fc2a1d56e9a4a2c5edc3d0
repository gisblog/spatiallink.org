<p>Our weather dashboard provides data updates every 2 seconds from our Davis Pro station on the roof off Tottenham Court Road, London. It includes live graphs and gauges (via highcharts) as well an historical view of data, yet the traditional webcam view of the actual physical view of the data has always been lacking. Streaming HD video content onto the web, 24 hours a day and in a format accessible across multiple platforms has until now been problematic. This is where YouTube Live comes in, currently in beta, the system allows a simple feed from a webcam (in our case a Logitech 930e) to be streamed live, along with additional overlays to provide realtime condition updates. It is not a case of simply pointing you camera to YouTube however, the encoding needs be carried out on the host machine and then streamed to YouTube for distribution. There are a number of options (see <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">YouTube Encoding</a>), having tried them all out we settled on Xsplit as the best current system:</p>
<div id="attachment_3700" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-3700" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-12-at-08.31.10-1024x726.png" alt="Encoding and Overlaying Data" width="570" height="404" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-12-at-08.31.10-300x213.png 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-12-at-08.31.10-768x544.png 768w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-12-at-08.31.10-1024x726.png 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-12-at-08.31.10.png 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Encoding and Overlaying Data</p></div>
<p>Our stream runs at 720p, 30fps with an HTML overlay taken directly from the main weather landing page. This allows the current conditions to be viewed in realtime, the move to 30fps and HD makes a notable difference &#8211; it creates a window into the world, updating in realtime and providing a smooth, natural view of the city, you can view the stream direct below:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ubf5HDhbGTA" width="620" height="380" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The stream is aimed at viewing fullscreen &#8211; 720p has its limitations but is a current balance. The system accepts a 1080p feed but the encoding machine takes a notable hit on processing power. With a 24/7 feed we opted for the balance of a smooth stream and medium demands on machine capacity. Bandwidth is of course all important, the feed is coming direct from a home based fibre option feed, offering 500mb uploads over wifi and unlimited data. It is this option that is opening up the ability to create data windows on the world and perhaps a true view of the city in realtime.</p>

The simple example pictured above details a pFlow dialogue determining the birth of particles linked to a target geometry. The particles can subsequently be baked (using<a href="http://www.oferz.com/maxscripts.php"> pFlow Baker</a>) into an animation timeline for simple output via .fbx, allowing import into external systems such as Unity or Lumion.</p>

The particles can subsequently be baked (using<a href="http://www.oferz.com/maxscripts.php"> pFlow Baker</a>) into an animation timeline for simple output via .fbx, allowing import into external systems such as Unity or Lumion.</p>

While CASA has a tendency to spend a lot of time thinking seriously about cities and data it was quickly decided that a fun and novel way to engage the 100,000 or so expected visitors would be an urban roller coaster ride using the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset. <a href="http://virtualarchitectures.wordpress.com/">Oliver Dawkins</a>, a student on our <a href="http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/programmes/postgraduate">MRes in Advanced Spatial Analysis</a> is a leading light in urban visualisation and the Oculus Rift, as such he kindly offered to lead the development. In the following guest post, Oliver (of <a href="http://virtualarchitectures.wordpress.com/">http://virtualarchitectures.wordpress.com/</a>) talks us through the development process&#8230;.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/104185315?title=0" width="600" height="337" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><a href="http://vimeo.com/104185315">CASA Urban Roller Coaster</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/virtualarchitectures">Virtual Architectures</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</center>The first tool chosen for this project was the Unity game engine because it provides a very simple means of integrating the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset into a real-time 3D experience. Initial tests were made in Unity with a pre-made roller coaster model downloaded from the Unity Asset Store. However, rather than simply place that roller coaster in an urban setting I wanted to create a track that would be unique to this experience and feel like it might have been part of the urban infrastructure. Due to time constraints it was not possible to model the urban scene from scratch. Instead I decided to generate it procedurally in Autodesk 3ds MAX using a great free script called ghostTown Lite.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3658" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_01-1024x528.jpg" alt="" width="654" height="295" /></p>
<p>Although I like to use SketchUp for 3D modelling wherever possible 3ds MAX was much better suited to this project as it allowed me to quickly generate the city scene, model the roller coaster track, and animate the path of the ride, all in the one software package. After generating the urban scene I used the car from the Asset Store roller coaster as a guide for modelling my track in the correct proportions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3659" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_02-1024x528.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_02" width="687" height="354" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_02-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_02-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_02.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></p>
<p>The path of the ride through the city was modeled using Bezier splines, first in the Top view to get the rough layout and then in the Front and Left views to ensure the path would clear the buildings in my scene. The experience needed to be comfortable to users who may not have experienced virtual reality before so it was agreed to exclude loop-the-loops on this occasion. It was also important to avoid bends that would be too sharp for roller coaster to realistically follow. Once I was happy with the path I welded all the vertices in my splines so that the path could be used to animate the movement of the roller coaster car along the track later.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3660" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_03-1024x528.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_03" width="700" height="361" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_03-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_03.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Next sections of track were added to the path I’d created using the 3ds MAX PathDeform (WSM) modifier. As the name suggests this modifier deforms selected geometry to follow a chosen path. Using this modifier massively simplified the process by allowing my pre-made sections of track to be offset along the length of the path and then stretched, rotated and twisted to fit together as seamlessly as possible. This was the most intricate and time consuming part of the project.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3661" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_04-1024x528.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_04" width="708" height="365" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_04-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_04.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /></p>
<p>In order to minimise the the potential for motion sickness with the Oculus Rift I was careful to keep the rotation of the track as close to the horizontal plane as possible. Supporting struts were then arrayed along the path of the track and positioned in order to anchor it to the rest of the scene. When I was satisfied a ‘Snapshot’ was made of the geometry in 3ds MAX to create a single mesh ready for export to Unity. At this point the path deformed sections of track could be deleted as Unity does not recognise the modifier.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3662" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05-1024x528.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05" width="747" height="385" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></p>
<p>To create the movement of the roller coaster car along the track a 3ds MAX dummy helper was constrained to the path I’d created earlier. This generated starting and ending key frames on the animation timeline. The roller coaster car model was then placed on the track and linked to the dummy helper. It is possible in 3ds Max to have the velocity and banking of the dummy calculated automatically, but I found that this did not give a realistic feel. Instead I controlled both by editing the animation key frames using a camera linked to the dummy for reference. This was time intensive but gave a better result. The city scene, roller coaster and animation were exported as a single FBX which is the preferred import format for 3D geometry in Unity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3663" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06-1024x528.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06" width="654" height="337" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /></p>
<p>Having completed the track and animated the car it was time to assemble the final scene in Unity. First I generated a terrain using a great plugin called World Composer. This enables you to import satellite imagery and terrain heights from Bing maps to give your backdrops a high degree of realism.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3664" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07" width="769" height="395" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p>The urban scene and roller coaster were then imported and a skybox and directional light were added. The scene was completed with various assets from the Unity Asset Store including skyscrapers, roof objects, vehicles, idling characters and a flock of birds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3666" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09" width="787" height="404" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /></p>
<p>To prepare the Oculus Rift integration the OVR camera controller asset from Oculus was placed inside and parented to the roller coaster car. In my initial tests with the Asset Store roller coaster I’d found that OVR camera would drift from the forward facing position. This would disorientate the user and contribute to motion sickness. To prevent it with a quick fix I parented a cube to the front of the roller coaster car, turned off rendering of the cube so it would be invisible, and set the camera controller to follow the cube.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3667" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10" width="801" height="411" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>
<p>In order to ensure the best possible virtual experience it is really important to keep the rendered frames per second as high as possible. As the Oculus Rift renders two cameras simultaneously, one for each eye, you need to aim to render 60 fps in Unity so as to ensure the user can expect to experience a frame rate of 30 fps.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this I took advantage of occlusion culling in Unity Pro which prevents objects being rendered when they are outside the camera’s field of view or obscured by other objects.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3668" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11" width="777" height="399" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></p>
<p>I also baked the shadows for all static objects in the scene to save them as textures which saves the processor calculating them dynamically. The only objects casting dynamic shadows are the roller coaster car and animated characters.</p>
<p>Finally two simple java scripts were added. The first would start the roller coaster and <img class="alignright wp-image-3669 size-full" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/uclprovost3.jpg" alt="uclprovost3" width="460" height="340" />play a roller coaster sound file upon pressing the ‘S’ key. The second closed the roller coaster application upon pressing the ‘Esc’ key.</p>
<p>The reception of the CASA Urban Roller Coaster ride at Grand Designs Live was fantastic and I’m really pleased to have participated. It was a great project to work on and an excellent opportunity to learn new techniques in 3ds MAX and Unity. Having my first VR roller coaster under my belt I’m looking forward to building another truly terrifying one when I get the time, hopefully for the Oculus Rift DK2 which has just arrived at CASA.</p>
<p>On a last note I’d like to thank Tom Hoffman of Lake Earie Digital whose excellent YouTube tutorials on creating roller coasters in 3ds MAX provided a great guide through the most difficult part of this challenging project.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3662" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05-1024x528.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05" width="747" height="385" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_05.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></p>
<p>To create the movement of the roller coaster car along the track a 3ds MAX dummy helper was constrained to the path I’d created earlier. This generated starting and ending key frames on the animation timeline. The roller coaster car model was then placed on the track and linked to the dummy helper. It is possible in 3ds Max to have the velocity and banking of the dummy calculated automatically, but I found that this did not give a realistic feel. Instead I controlled both by editing the animation key frames using a camera linked to the dummy for reference. This was time intensive but gave a better result. The city scene, roller coaster and animation were exported as a single FBX which is the preferred import format for 3D geometry in Unity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3663" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06-1024x528.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06" width="654" height="337" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_06.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /></p>
<p>Having completed the track and animated the car it was time to assemble the final scene in Unity. First I generated a terrain using a great plugin called World Composer. This enables you to import satellite imagery and terrain heights from Bing maps to give your backdrops a high degree of realism.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3664" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07" width="769" height="395" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_07.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p>The urban scene and roller coaster were then imported and a skybox and directional light were added. The scene was completed with various assets from the Unity Asset Store including skyscrapers, roof objects, vehicles, idling characters and a flock of birds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3666" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09" width="787" height="404" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_09.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /></p>
<p>To prepare the Oculus Rift integration the OVR camera controller asset from Oculus was placed inside and parented to the roller coaster car. In my initial tests with the Asset Store roller coaster I’d found that OVR camera would drift from the forward facing position. This would disorientate the user and contribute to motion sickness. To prevent it with a quick fix I parented a cube to the front of the roller coaster car, turned off rendering of the cube so it would be invisible, and set the camera controller to follow the cube.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3667" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10" width="801" height="411" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_10.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>
<p>In order to ensure the best possible virtual experience it is really important to keep the rendered frames per second as high as possible. As the Oculus Rift renders two cameras simultaneously, one for each eye, you need to aim to render 60 fps in Unity so as to ensure the user can expect to experience a frame rate of 30 fps.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this I took advantage of occlusion culling in Unity Pro which prevents objects being rendered when they are outside the camera’s field of view or obscured by other objects.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3668" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11-1024x526.jpg" alt="making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11" width="777" height="399" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11-300x154.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11-1024x526.jpg 1024w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/making_of_casa_roller_coaster_11.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></p>
<p>I also baked the shadows for all static objects in the scene to save them as textures which saves the processor calculating them dynamically. The only objects casting dynamic shadows are the roller coaster car and animated characters.</p>
<p>Finally two simple java scripts were added. The first would start the roller coaster and <img class="alignright wp-image-3669 size-full" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/uclprovost3.jpg" alt="uclprovost3" width="460" height="340" />play a roller coaster sound file upon pressing the ‘S’ key. The second closed the roller coaster application upon pressing the ‘Esc’ key.</p>
<p>The reception of the CASA Urban Roller Coaster ride at Grand Designs Live was fantastic and I’m really pleased to have participated. It was a great project to work on and an excellent opportunity to learn new techniques in 3ds MAX and Unity. Having my first VR roller coaster under my belt I’m looking forward to building another truly terrifying one when I get the time, hopefully for the Oculus Rift DK2 which has just arrived at CASA.</p>
<p>On a last note I’d like to thank Tom Hoffman of Lake Earie Digital whose excellent YouTube tutorials on creating roller coasters in 3ds MAX provided a great guide through the most difficult part of this challenging project.</p>

<p>As Course Director, i am pleased to announce the new MSc and MRes in Smart Cities, here at the The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. Both the MSc and MRes offer an innovative and exciting opportunity to study at UCL &#8211; with key training for a new career in the emerging Smart Cities market. Smart cities are focused on how computers, data, and analytics which consist of models and predictions, are being embedded into cities. Cities  currently are being extensively wired, thus generating new kinds of control and new kinds of services, which are producing massive data streams – ‘big data’.  To this end, we need powerful analytics to make sense of this new world with a new skill set to understanding and lead this new field.</p>
<p><strong>CASA</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk">Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis</a> (CASA) is one of the leading forces in the science of cities, generating new knowledge and insights for use in city planning, policy and design and drawing on the latest geospatial methods and ideas in computer-based visualisation and modelling.</p>
<p>CASA’s focus is to be at the forefront of what is one of the grand challenges of 21st Century science: to build a science of cities from a multidisciplinary base, drawing on cutting edge methods, and ideas in modeling, complexity, visualisation and computation. Our current mix of architects, geographers, mathematicians, physicists, urban planners and computer scientists make CASA a unique department within UCL.</p>
<p>Our vision is to be central to this new science, the science of smart cities, and relate it to city planning, policy and architecture in its widest sense.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATIONAL AIMS OF THE PROGRAMME</strong></p>
<p>The MSc Smart Cities and Urban Analytics comprises 180 credits which can be taken full-time over 12 months or on a flexible modular basis of up to 5 years duration (full details of the <a href="http://mscsmartcities.org/mres-smart-cities/">MRes structure can be found here</a>.  If taken full time over one year, the following structure is followed:</p>
<p><strong>TERM ONE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smart Systems Theory<br />
</strong>The module provides a comprehensive introduction to a theory and science of cities. Many different perspectives developed by urban researchers, systems theorists, complexity theorists, urban planners, geographers and transport engineers will be considered, such as spatial interactions and transport models, urban economic theories, scaling laws and the central place theory for systems of cities, growth, migration, etc., to name a few. The course will also focus on physical planning and urban policy analysis as has been developed in western countries during the last 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>The class runs during term one, for two hours per week</strong><br />
<strong>Assessment is by coursework (2,500 – 3,000 words)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Methods<br />
</strong>This module will empower you with essential mathematical techniques to be able to describe quantitatively many aspects of a city. You will learn various methodologies, from traditional statistical techniques, to more novel approaches, such as complex networks. These techniques will focus on different scales and hierarchies, from the micro-level, e.g. individual interactions, to the macro-level, e.g. regional properties, taking into account both discrete and continuous variables, and using probabilistic and deterministic approaches. All these tools will be developed within the context of real world applications.</p>

<article><strong></strong><strong>Geographic Information Systems and Science</strong></article>
<div>GI Systems and Science aims to equip students with an understanding of the principles underlying the conception, representation/measurement and analysis of spatial phenomena. It presents an overview of the core organising concepts and techniques of Geographic Information Systems, and the software and analysis systems that are integral to their effective deployment in advanced spatial analysis.The practical sessions in the course will introduce students to both traditional and emerging technologies in geographical information science through the use of desktop GIS software like Arc GIS and Quantum GIS, and the powerful statistical software environment, R. In developing technical expertise in these software tools, students will be introduced to real-world geographical analysis problems and, by the end of the course, will be able to identify, evaluate and process geographic data from a variety of different sources, analyse these data and present the results of the analysis using different cartographic techniques.</div>

<p>As Course Director, i am pleased to announce the new MSc and MRes in Smart Cities, here at the The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. Both the MSc and MRes offer an innovative and exciting opportunity to study at UCL &#8211; with key training for a new career in the emerging Smart Cities market. Smart cities are focused on how computers, data, and analytics which consist of models and predictions, are being embedded into cities. Cities  currently are being extensively wired, thus generating new kinds of control and new kinds of services, which are producing massive data streams – ‘big data’.  To this end, we need powerful analytics to make sense of this new world with a new skill set to understanding and lead this new field.</p>
<p><strong>CASA</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk">Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis</a> (CASA) is one of the leading forces in the science of cities, generating new knowledge and insights for use in city planning, policy and design and drawing on the latest geospatial methods and ideas in computer-based visualisation and modelling.</p>
<p>CASA’s focus is to be at the forefront of what is one of the grand challenges of 21st Century science: to build a science of cities from a multidisciplinary base, drawing on cutting edge methods, and ideas in modeling, complexity, visualisation and computation. Our current mix of architects, geographers, mathematicians, physicists, urban planners and computer scientists make CASA a unique department within UCL.</p>
<p>Our vision is to be central to this new science, the science of smart cities, and relate it to city planning, policy and architecture in its widest sense.</p>

<p><strong>EDUCATIONAL AIMS OF THE PROGRAMME</strong></p>
<p>The MSc Smart Cities and Urban Analytics comprises 180 credits which can be taken full-time over 12 months or on a flexible modular basis of up to 5 years duration (full details of the <a href="http://mscsmartcities.org/mres-smart-cities/">MRes structure can be found here</a>.  If taken full time over one year, the following structure is followed:</p>
<p><strong>TERM ONE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smart Systems Theory<br />
</strong>The module provides a comprehensive introduction to a theory and science of cities. Many different perspectives developed by urban researchers, systems theorists, complexity theorists, urban planners, geographers and transport engineers will be considered, such as spatial interactions and transport models, urban economic theories, scaling laws and the central place theory for systems of cities, growth, migration, etc., to name a few. The course will also focus on physical planning and urban policy analysis as has been developed in western countries during the last 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>The class runs during term one, for two hours per week</strong><br />
<strong>Assessment is by coursework (2,500 – 3,000 words)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Methods<br />
</strong>This module will empower you with essential mathematical techniques to be able to describe quantitatively many aspects of a city. You will learn various methodologies, from traditional statistical techniques, to more novel approaches, such as complex networks. These techniques will focus on different scales and hierarchies, from the micro-level, e.g. individual interactions, to the macro-level, e.g. regional properties, taking into account both discrete and continuous variables, and using probabilistic and deterministic approaches. All these tools will be developed within the context of real world applications.</p>

<article><strong></strong><strong>Geographic Information Systems and Science</strong></article>
<div>GI Systems and Science aims to equip students with an understanding of the principles underlying the conception, representation/measurement and analysis of spatial phenomena. It presents an overview of the core organising concepts and techniques of Geographic Information Systems, and the software and analysis systems that are integral to their effective deployment in advanced spatial analysis.The practical sessions in the course will introduce students to both traditional and emerging technologies in geographical information science through the use of desktop GIS software like Arc GIS and Quantum GIS, and the powerful statistical software environment, R. In developing technical expertise in these software tools, students will be introduced to real-world geographical analysis problems and, by the end of the course, will be able to identify, evaluate and process geographic data from a variety of different sources, analyse these data and present the results of the analysis using different cartographic techniques.</div>

With the ability to connect the bulbs to a network and select colours according to a hex colour &#8211;  the logical link was to link the bulbs to the weather data, allowing the lighting to change according to the external temperature and in sync with the web dashboard.</p>

<p>Once the bulbs are connected to the network there are a variety of third party services that can be used to control the bulbs, either as a group or individually. One of our current favourites here at CASA is IF This Then That (<a href="https://ifttt.com/dashboard">IFTTT</a>), IFTTT is a service that allows the creation of simple &#8216;recipes&#8217;, linking popular online systems via a series of rules. Among the services linked on IFTTT is the <a href="http://www.netatmo.com/">Netatmo Weather Station </a>and the Philips Hue.</p>
<div id="attachment_3566" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3566  " title="Netatmo Weather Station" alt="Netatmo Weather Station" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/netatmo1.jpg" width="570" height="278" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/netatmo1-300x146.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/netatmo1.jpg 1017w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Netatmo Weather Station</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are using the Netatmo in CASA as part of our forthcoming office data dashboard, it monitors internal temperature, humidity, sound levels and carbon dioxide with an external unit providing temperature and humidity readings.</p>

<p></center>Our <a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/weather/colours.html">Colours Weather Dashboard</a> changes its background every 5 degrees centigrade, as such via IFTTT it is possible to create a series of recipes using the same colour range and link it to a temperature reading from the external Netatmo unit.</p>
<div id="attachment_3559" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3559 " title="If This Then That Recipes" alt="If This Then That Recipes" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-01-at-12.55.51.png" width="595" height="791" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-01-at-12.55.51-770x1024.png 770w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-01-at-12.55.51.png 992w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">If This Then That Recipes</p></div>
<p>IFTTT is an emerging service, as such it does have a number of limitations. We had to create a recipe for each temperature change, rather than combining it into one logical statement. IFTTT also only checks the readings from external services every 15 minutes, making it unsuitable for rapidly changing data. Finally, there do seem to be a few bugs, the hex colour does not seem to create a direct match to the Hue light, so a few tweaks are required to gain the correct colour output.</p>

<p>It is probably a niche market, but the linking of data to lighting is an intriguing development. From making the lights blink when carbon dioxide levels in the office rise through to changing colours according to a twitter or rss feed, we are excited by the possibilities.</p>

We will be mounting the &#8216;weather bulb&#8217; in a small globe and placing it in the corner of the office. The Philips Hue starter pack comes with three bulbs, 50 lights can be linked to each bridge. With the ability to link each bulb, or a group of bulbs, to almost any data feed, the office is about to become a colourful place&#8230;</p>

With the ability to connect the bulbs to a network and select colours according to a hex colour &#8211;  the logical link was to link the bulbs to the weather data, allowing the lighting to change according to the external temperature and in sync with the web dashboard.</p>
<div id="attachment_3556" style="width: 656px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3556   " title="Philips Hue" alt="Philips Hue" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Hue.jpg" width="646" height="362" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Philips Hue</p></div>
<p>Once the bulbs are connected to the network there are a variety of third party services that can be used to control the bulbs, either as a group or individually. One of our current favourites here at CASA is IF This Then That (<a href="https://ifttt.com/dashboard">IFTTT</a>), IFTTT is a service that allows the creation of simple &#8216;recipes&#8217;, linking popular online systems via a series of rules. Among the services linked on IFTTT is the <a href="http://www.netatmo.com/">Netatmo Weather Station </a>and the Philips Hue.</p>
<div id="attachment_3566" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3566  " title="Netatmo Weather Station" alt="Netatmo Weather Station" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/netatmo1.jpg" width="570" height="278" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/netatmo1-300x146.jpg 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/netatmo1.jpg 1017w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Netatmo Weather Station</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are using the Netatmo in CASA as part of our forthcoming office data dashboard, it monitors internal temperature, humidity, sound levels and carbon dioxide with an external unit providing temperature and humidity readings.</p>
<p><center></p>
<div id="attachment_3555" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3555" alt="Colour Range" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Colours-300x49.png" width="300" height="49" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Colours-300x49.png 300w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Colours.png 763w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Colour Range</p></div>
<p></center>Our <a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/weather/colours.html">Colours Weather Dashboard</a> changes its background every 5 degrees centigrade, as such via IFTTT it is possible to create a series of recipes using the same colour range and link it to a temperature reading from the external Netatmo unit.</p>
<div id="attachment_3559" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3559 " title="If This Then That Recipes" alt="If This Then That Recipes" src="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-01-at-12.55.51.png" width="595" height="791" srcset="http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-01-at-12.55.51-770x1024.png 770w, http://www.digitalurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-01-at-12.55.51.png 992w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">If This Then That Recipes</p></div>
<p>IFTTT is an emerging service, as such it does have a number of limitations. We had to create a recipe for each temperature change, rather than combining it into one logical statement. IFTTT also only checks the readings from external services every 15 minutes, making it unsuitable for rapidly changing data. Finally, there do seem to be a few bugs, the hex colour does not seem to create a direct match to the Hue light, so a few tweaks are required to gain the correct colour output.</p>

There has never been a better time to look into the research and commercial opportunities around cities and data (as our forthcoming MSc in Smart Cities highlights, more on that in a future post). As such the new initiative linking up Level39 and the Future Cities Catapult is one of potential. The full press release went out in July, so this a little late to the table in terms of the blog post, but the it is the concept of linking cities research/innovation and financing start ups that we feel is notably timely, the press release with details is below:</p>
<p>The UK’s Future Cities movement is set to receive a major boost, thanks to a new initiative by the Future Cities Catapult and Level39, Europe’s largest accelerator space for financial, retail and future city technologies, based at Canary Wharf.</p>
<p>Launched in March this year, the <a href="https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/home">Future Cities Catapult</a> is an independent innovation centre set up by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB). It aims to help UK businesses develop cutting-edge, high value urban solutions and then sell them to the world. The Catapult will unite business, city governments, innovators and academia to run a series of large-scale pilot projects that address how cities can become more economically active, while lowering their environmental footprint and moving towards a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>The Future Cities Catapult is prioritising the ‘Future Cities Financing’ aspect of their work programme to address the need for large-scale investment into the sector. Growing cities represent a great opportunity to develop innovative technologies that have the potential to provide a major boost to the UK economy.nMore than £6.5tn will be invested globally in city infrastructure over the next 10 to 15 years. Of this, the accessible market for companies developing future city systems is estimated to be worth £200bn a year by 2030. Critical to the flourishing of future cities is greater access to finance for integrated city systems (not simply the traditional model of investment in specific projects in areas such as transport, energy and health).</p>
<p>The Future Cities Catapult will focus on developing and leveraging finance for cohesive city systems as a key area of activity in future. This work has begun by tasking Level39 with pulling together experts from within its extensive finance and investor networks to raise awareness of investment opportunities and draw upon their knowledge to debate the merits of the current or potential new funding models.</p>
<p>Peter Madden, Chief Executive, Future Cities Catapult, said: “In the future, the majority of people will live in cities. There are huge benefits to people and opportunities for business in making cities better places to live, but at present we lack the financial mechanisms to unlock these opportunities.</p>
<p>“Future Cities Financing will explore the challenges, opportunities and risk profiles for different kinds of investment. By engaging with the right financial stakeholders, we can also amplify the message <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">that investment in smart cities is a new and highly valuable asset class.”</span></p>
<p>Eric Van Der Kleij, Head of Level39 at Canary Wharf Group plc says:</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">supporting the Future Cities Catapult by creating the right blend of industry experts to debate the crucial issue of future cities financing.” “The built environment at Canary Wharf is one of the most technologically advanced in London and we will continue this journey at Level39 by facilitating new innovation in future cities technology. Our </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">location alongside the capital’s leading financial district and extensive contacts, which include finance specialists, fund managers and investors, will enable us to help unlock vital sources of funding.”</span></p>
<p>The clip below provides a good insight into Level39 &#8211; having been there a couple of times we can safely say its an exciting place:</p>

There has never been a better time to look into the research and commercial opportunities around cities and data (as our forthcoming MSc in Smart Cities highlights, more on that in a future post). As such the new initiative linking up Level39 and the Future Cities Catapult is one of potential. The full press release went out in July, so this a little late to the table in terms of the blog post, but the it is the concept of linking cities research/innovation and financing start ups that we feel is notably timely, the press release with details is below:</p>
<p>The UK’s Future Cities movement is set to receive a major boost, thanks to a new initiative by the Future Cities Catapult and Level39, Europe’s largest accelerator space for financial, retail and future city technologies, based at Canary Wharf.</p>
<p>Launched in March this year, the <a href="https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/home">Future Cities Catapult</a> is an independent innovation centre set up by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB). It aims to help UK businesses develop cutting-edge, high value urban solutions and then sell them to the world. The Catapult will unite business, city governments, innovators and academia to run a series of large-scale pilot projects that address how cities can become more economically active, while lowering their environmental footprint and moving towards a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>The Future Cities Catapult is prioritising the ‘Future Cities Financing’ aspect of their work programme to address the need for large-scale investment into the sector. Growing cities represent a great opportunity to develop innovative technologies that have the potential to provide a major boost to the UK economy.nMore than £6.5tn will be invested globally in city infrastructure over the next 10 to 15 years. Of this, the accessible market for companies developing future city systems is estimated to be worth £200bn a year by 2030. Critical to the flourishing of future cities is greater access to finance for integrated city systems (not simply the traditional model of investment in specific projects in areas such as transport, energy and health).</p>
<p>The Future Cities Catapult will focus on developing and leveraging finance for cohesive city systems as a key area of activity in future. This work has begun by tasking Level39 with pulling together experts from within its extensive finance and investor networks to raise awareness of investment opportunities and draw upon their knowledge to debate the merits of the current or potential new funding models.</p>
<p>Peter Madden, Chief Executive, Future Cities Catapult, said: “In the future, the majority of people will live in cities. There are huge benefits to people and opportunities for business in making cities better places to live, but at present we lack the financial mechanisms to unlock these opportunities.</p>
<p>“Future Cities Financing will explore the challenges, opportunities and risk profiles for different kinds of investment. By engaging with the right financial stakeholders, we can also amplify the message <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">that investment in smart cities is a new and highly valuable asset class.”</span></p>
<p>Eric Van Der Kleij, Head of Level39 at Canary Wharf Group plc says:</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">supporting the Future Cities Catapult by creating the right blend of industry experts to debate the crucial issue of future cities financing.” “The built environment at Canary Wharf is one of the most technologically advanced in London and we will continue this journey at Level39 by facilitating new innovation in future cities technology. Our </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">location alongside the capital’s leading financial district and extensive contacts, which include finance specialists, fund managers and investors, will enable us to help unlock vital sources of funding.”</span></p>
<p>The clip below provides a good insight into Level39 &#8211; having been there a couple of times we can safely say its an exciting place:</p>
