<br />
The opening day of the 5th ESRI Education User Conference, Saturday July 23, included two notable events: a briefing by Roger Downs about the forthcoming National Research Council Report "Learning to Think Spatially" and a keynote address by map collector David Rumsey. <br />
<br />
Downs, who heads the department of geography at Penn State, previewed the long-awaited NRC report to an eager audience of about 50 educators. The report's authors, a panel of psychologists, cognitive scientists, education specialists, geographers, and others, define spatial thinking in terms of spatial concepts, representation, and processes of reasoning. <br />
<br />
As an example, Downs challenged the audience to deduce the shortest path (along walls, ceiling, or floor) between two points on opposite sides of a room. He then demonstrated how projecting the 3-D space to a 2-D representation is the key to revealing the optimal solution. <br />
<br />
Spatial thinking, the NRC report argues, involves cognitive skills that are integral to everyday life. Such skills that can be learned, but age, cognitive development level, biological sex, and cultural gender, account for differences in performance between individuals and groups.  <br />
<br />
Spatial reasoning skills are implicit in national science and math standards for K-12 education. Those standards do not currently specify when and how such skills are to be mastered, however. Spatial thinking, the report observes, is U.S. K-12 education's "blind spot." <br />
<br />
The NRC report promotes a re-conceptualization of GIS as an environment that supports spatial thinking. It argues that GIS software needs to be redesigned to meet educational goals, to accommodate student needs, and to accommodate the limitations of educational settings. <br />
<br />
While his claims for the value of spatial thinking obviously resonated with audience members, several attendees disagreed strongly with the assertion that students are failing to master spatial thinking because of the failings of GIS software. Downs responded gently that the experiences of the highly successful educators attending the EdUC might not be representative of the 17,000 school districts in the U.S. The NRC report seems certain to spark discussion and debate in conferences, in faculty break rooms, and hopefully in the halls of Congress, when it is finally released later this summer.<br />
<br />
Rare is the GIS conference-goer who is not a cartophile at heart. David Rumsey's opening keynote address was a Saturday matinee for cartophiles-a narrated museum tour of beautiful and peculiar historical cartographic images.  <br />
<br />
Over 20 years Rumsey has amassed a collection of over 150,000 maps, atlases, globes, and similar artifacts, most associated with parts of North or South America in the 18th and 19th centuries. <br />
<br />
Catering to his EdUC audience, Rumsey selected images of rare school atlases, pocket globes, map puzzles, and geographical games used to teach to our great- and great-great-grandparents.  <br />
<br />
Rumsey noted that pupils were often expected to copy meticulously detailed maps as a way to memorize the shapes of continents, rivers, and boundaries, and the names of places and features. Globes and timelines frequently exploited the third and fourth dimensions. He stressed that school maps were typically beautifully crafted so as to capture the imaginations of their young audiences. <br />
<br />
Selections from his ESRI Press book Cartographica Extraordinaire illustrated the historical evolution of map imagery from copperplate engravings to satellite image data.<br />
<br />
More impressive even that Rumsey's extensive and often whimsical collection is his commitment to making high-quality images available to the public. Over 11,000 images are available for free viewing, printing, and downloading <a href="http://www.directionsmag.com/blog/exit.php?url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYXZpZHJ1bXNleS5jb20g&amp;entry_id=429" title="http://www.davidrumsey.com " onmouseover="window.status='http://www.davidrumsey.com ';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='';return true;">here</A>. <br />

<B>What it is</B><br />
<br />
used for imagery management of large quantities of images, process them in a server &amp; distribute to clients<br />
<br />
provides fast access and server based processing of raw imagery (10's of TB potentially) straight off the sensor.<br />
<br />
<B>Methodology</B><br />
<br />
store primary data in files (or import to rdbms if required) create services on server<br />
  harvest metadata<br />
  build catalog index<br />
  define processing chain<br />
can publish the image service on the server and multiple users can access can host more than one imagery service on a server<br />
<br />
<B>Benefits</B><br />
<br />
rapid access without any pre-processing (orthorectify, radiometric  correction, filtering) no dbms load very fast otf server side processing multiple products from single source with different process chains dynamic update of image services as new images become available.<br />
 simply copy files to server, add a metadata catalog and you're  ready to go.<br />
 <br />
<B>Demo</B><br />
<br />
product originates from a product called PromptServer<br />
<br />
8500 landsat scenes 8.5 tb of tiff files stored on the server.<br />
image overviews are created by the server (managed overviews) if imagery changes, server recreates the overviews<br />
<br />
server extracts pixels from raw source imagery, mosaics, radiometric corrects, pansharpens and reprojection from multiple UTM zones to Lat/Long on the fly, in seconds.<br />
<br />
can compute otf a band432 false color PS IR from landsat <br />
<br />
can create NDVI otf, each time you pan or zoom - all from the raw landsat data.<br />
<br />
<br />
(40,000 tiles) can handle SRTM data - create hillshaded terrain surface on the fly<br />
<br />
1:500k scanned maps of the world in tiff format. They have been georeferenced, but the collar clipping happens on the fly, as well as a reprojection and a mosaicing. Subsampling only occurs once, so the image quality is fairly pristine.<br />
<br />
<br />
demo was running on a workstation class machine with 2gb of ram, not a server class machine, and was blazingly fast.<br />
<br />
serve quickbird imagery - 16bit basic imagery straight off the digital globe cd - raw imagery. does radiometric correction, reprojection, orthorecitfication (from SRTM) pansharpening and mosaicing into a 60cm natural color image created otf.<br />
<br />
can take pan imagery and convert it to bands 421 (false color).<br />
can then compute ndvi and water detection otf.<br />
<br />
can change properties of the process chain on the fly, such as subsampling and supersampling properties, etc.<br />
Can edit the metadata information, which does get sent to the client as XML ( how the image was processed, date, etc)<br />
<br />
can jpg compress the final output of the processing chain before serving it - for low bandwidth connections. you don't have to compress your base product - it remains very high resolution. You can use the compressed layer for most of your work and only show the full res product when zoomed in to a very small area.<br />
<br />
can be used to serve scanned cadastral drawings and have them projected to a known coordinate system. could be very important for counties without digital parcel gis systems to serve their cadastral information to the national map or state level portals such as NC OneMap.<br />
<br />
<br />
can load digital camera imagery and metadata (imu, xyx, etc) and with an existing terrain model, have the system do the orthorectification on the fly. great for disaster response situations where you do not have time to wait. you could have online orthos in a matter of days instead of months. we could have used that last fall after all the hurricane damage in western NC.<br />
<br />
imagery is not just used for a natural background. Analytical datasets and terrain models are imagery data. much vector data is extraced from imagery and imagery is quite often used for verification of vector data. the new image server will allow much imagery that languishes on disk or tape or in historic archives to be made immediately available to end users on their desktop without the huge overhead of pre-processing, georeferencing, orthorectification, etc.<br />
<br />
volume of acquired imagery is growing exponentially, we need systems to provide quick access that doesn't involve loading into a rdbms.<br />
<br />
value of imagery devalues quickly with time, but ironically it<br />
also increases in value again once more time has passed.<br />
<br />
paradigm shift merges the processing and distribution stages<br />
of the imagery.<br />
 nearly no pre-processing<br />
 quick to generate<br />
 very low latency<br />
 create multiple products from same source<br />
 can update very quickly<br />
 huge disk space savings<br />
 <br />
<B>More Demos</B><br />
<br />
how to create an image service:<br />
start catalog manager<br />
name the service<br />
add image(s) to the service (can add whole directories)<br />
set basic options<br />
compute statistics, generate overviews, metadata table &amp; footprints<br />
create the service<br />
<br />
can change other properties and processing chains (interpolation, <br />
crop method, transparency, compression, filters, georeferencing,<br />
pan sharpening, histograms, you name it...)<br />
<br />
<B>Data Flow</B><br />
<br />
input imagery<br />
process chaining<br />
compress<br />
display<br />
<br />
accepts many formats (1 to 32 bits per channel)<br />
 tif, geotif<br />
   jpg, lzw packbit<br />
   flat, scanline, tiled (optimal)<br />
   <br />
 bil, bsq, bip<br />
 jp2000, mrsid, ecw<br />
 nitf, hda img(GDAL) (USES GDAL [open source library for imagery - Ed.] INTERNALLY TO DO THE TRANSLATIONS!!!!)<br />
 sde raster<br />
 oracle georaster<br />
 <br />
there is an SDK so users can add their own image formats<br />
<br />
compression: store compressed or uncompressed  (preferable, disk is cheap)<br />
compression derived products on the fly for end users<br />
<br />
the input processing is applied to each individual image and<br />
can be different for each input image (radiometry). processing<br />
parameters can be stored in the process definition xml file or<br />
in the database, which is easier to manage for large image<br />
<br />
band extraction, band algebra for multiband imagery<br />
 321 true color, 742 false color ir, 432 near ir false color, nvdi, etc<br />
subsampling &amp; supersampling<br />
 near neighbor, cubic convolution, bicubic, weighted matrix<br />
transparency<br />
enhance &amp; sharpen<br />
  brightness, contrast, gamma, equalize, dynamic based on histogram<br />
  bit depth conversion - e.g. 18bit to 8bit<br />
sharpening: convolution filter on the primary data, before the<br />
 rest of the processing, whcih will give the best results<br />
<br />
enhancing and sharpening in combination can be used to allow<br />
you to better see into the shadows<br />
<br />
coordinate conversions<br />
<br />
pan sharpening - fusion of high res b/w imagery with lower res color<br />
<br />
mosaicking/merging<br />
  can feather sides or do a seamline mosaic, or a straight merge<br />
  <br />
<br />
can change the viewpoint at the client end to you can look at both aspect/sides of features (building obscurity) in  imagery with lots of building lean and lots of overlap. great for property assessors, security consultants, utility companies, etc.<br />
<br />
can specify "best-on-top" (most nadir), Zorder (fields in DB), or client defined order (based on sun angle or some other parameter<br />
of interest)<br />
<br />
client can lock the order they want.<br />
<br />
<B>Another Demo</B><br />
<br />
can "blur out" certain secure areas of imagery in one service for general public use and create a separate, secure imagery service for authorized use that does not blur out the sensitive features.<br />
<br />
can hillshade and render raw dem or srtm or lidar data on the fly. can also merge in pockets of higher res data, such as lidar data from state and county collection projects and create a composite elevation surface.<br />
<br />
You can create your own special processing, logo stamping on the imagery, interface to Hierarchical Data Storage, or payment gateways for credit card purchases.<br />
<br />
There are 3 special extensions:<br />
<br />
  ortho- 3d transform, orient data, terrain (image or image service) <br />
  <br />
  mosaic (feather, seamline detection)<br />
  <br />
  iCOMP - image compensation (trend removal on small scale <br />
       aerial photos, color balancing) is not available yet<br />
       <br />
<br />
Client Side can control coord system, subsystem, compression for transmission, locking image, mosaic method. The client can't create new services though, the admin has to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<B>Scalability</B><br />
<br />
can load balance between multiple servers<br />
MULTIPLE - Servers + DAS (direct access storage disk array - recommended!)<br />
  lots of cheap ide disks that are mirrored is the best route<br />
  <br />
Multiple - Server - NAS/SAN (not recommended, they aren't optimized for huge chunks of data pumped across the network, and it will kill your caching)<br />
  <br />
Cascading Servers - one service can request a subset of data from another service and do other processing on it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
managing derived images - creating overviews: <br />
 provide faster access by pre-processing<br />
 define by using the service manager<br />
 the server monitors every request that is made, and you can get the results of these as a shapefile of footprints, so you can get a better idea of your usage patterns and then adjust the amount of preprocessed imagery you provide to your users, so that certain high priority or high use areas can be stored as "tiles" and given a higher priority rating in the imagery metadata catalog so the image server will use this tile and not have to do on the fly processing for heavily trafficked areas.<br />
  <br />
 <br />
 client server arch. can do secured access. <br />
 works well with legacy applications because you don't have to convert your imagery.<br />
 <br />
 ANY ESRI app can be used as a client.<br />
 Other clients are ERDAS, MicroStation, AutoCad, Mapfinfo<br />
 **** OGC WMS, there is a programming API so you can [use WMS clients]<br />
  <br />
 can input into SDE raster, Oracle georaster<br />
 <br />
services are open (db tables and xml) and can be automated with scripting as new imagery comes in.<br />
 <br />
product called Image Server Publisher <br />
can't author new services, but allows orgs to make copies of a full server to clients or depts (mirror a server) can  be used on server farms, disaster failover sites.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
<B>SDE Raster vs Image Server</B><br />
  <br />
  db storage - file storage<br />
  img has no dbms licensing and no data loading and no preprocessing<br />
<br />
  **IF security is a big deal, a dbms is the better choice<br />
  <br />
  image server and SDE are complimentary, you can serve<br />
  sde raster layers with it.<br />
  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
<B>The Product</B><br />
<br />
server &amp; manager modules<br />
 service manager<br />
 client plugins (out of the box for previewing data)<br />
  desktop, engine, server, 3rd party, OGC WMS<br />
  <br />
 extensions (planned)<br />
  mosaic, orhto, iCOMP<br />
  <br />
  <br />
publisher version - read-only, lower price, no service manager<br />
<br />
<br />
pricing - $10,000 for a 2 cpu configuration<br />
available on its on release cycle, probably end of October<br />
<br />
<B>Q&A</B><br />
<br />
Q:can output go to other places than the client viewer?<br />
<br />
A:yes, can script to go to a ftp site or storage device<br />
service admin can control how much of the extraction<br />
by client users can happen.<br />
<br />
Q: speed comparisons between image server &amp; Sde raster<br />
for same area of imagery on same server type?<br />
A: no, not yet if you have thousands of users trying to access a final<br />
product, sde is better tuned for that scenario. GIS users<br />
and specialized fields such as security, emergency response,<br />
would benefit more from the image server.<br />
<br />
Q: OS support? <br />
A: Windows only now, soon a Linux version, later<br />
other OS's, such as Solaris.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you use oblique imagery from Pictometery? you can load it but the tools are not quite there yet for generating accurate measurements. The team is communicating with several vendors and hopes to offer support in later versions.<br />
<br />
Q: For client developers who are developing front ends to use<br />
Imager Srever - how much support will there be for this<br />
type of work?  <br />
A: They claim the API is simple, and there's sample code, if you're a C programmer. No mention of the actual support offerings were given.<br />
<br />
There will be interface changes to the product to bring it into line with the ESRI look and feel. The service manager will not be part of ArcGIS immediately, but will be integrated into the family over time.<br />
<br />
Q: Multi-temporal imagery - how to handle different time series images for the same footprint area? <br />
A: you can define the Zorder field in your metadata catalog table and the client app can determine which Zorder field (latest, oldest, best sun angle, etc) to use during any working session. You can't 'hard code' a single order for everyone to use, or allow users to pass in complex SQL code to determine a sort order. You will need to write your own custom interfaces if you want to have that level of control.<br />

<B>What it is</B><br />
<br />
used for imagery management of large quantities of images, process them in a server &amp; distribute to clients<br />
<br />
provides fast access and server based processing of raw imagery (10's of TB potentially) straight off the sensor.<br />
<br />
<B>Methodology</B><br />
<br />
store primary data in files (or import to rdbms if required) create services on server<br />
  harvest metadata<br />
  build catalog index<br />
  define processing chain<br />
can publish the image service on the server and multiple users can access can host more than one imagery service on a server<br />
<br />
<B>Benefits</B><br />
<br />
rapid access without any pre-processing (orthorectify, radiometric  correction, filtering) no dbms load very fast otf server side processing multiple products from single source with different process chains dynamic update of image services as new images become available.<br />
 simply copy files to server, add a metadata catalog and you're  ready to go.<br />
 <br />
<B>Demo</B><br />
<br />
product originates from a product called PromptServer<br />
<br />
8500 landsat scenes 8.5 tb of tiff files stored on the server.<br />
image overviews are created by the server (managed overviews) if imagery changes, server recreates the overviews<br />
<br />
server extracts pixels from raw source imagery, mosaics, radiometric corrects, pansharpens and reprojection from multiple UTM zones to Lat/Long on the fly, in seconds.<br />
<br />
can compute otf a band432 false color PS IR from landsat <br />
<br />
can create NDVI otf, each time you pan or zoom - all from the raw landsat data.<br />
<br />
<br />
(40,000 tiles) can handle SRTM data - create hillshaded terrain surface on the fly<br />
<br />
1:500k scanned maps of the world in tiff format. They have been georeferenced, but the collar clipping happens on the fly, as well as a reprojection and a mosaicing. Subsampling only occurs once, so the image quality is fairly pristine.<br />
<br />
<br />
demo was running on a workstation class machine with 2gb of ram, not a server class machine, and was blazingly fast.<br />
<br />
serve quickbird imagery - 16bit basic imagery straight off the digital globe cd - raw imagery. does radiometric correction, reprojection, orthorecitfication (from SRTM) pansharpening and mosaicing into a 60cm natural color image created otf.<br />
<br />
can take pan imagery and convert it to bands 421 (false color).<br />
can then compute ndvi and water detection otf.<br />
<br />
can change properties of the process chain on the fly, such as subsampling and supersampling properties, etc.<br />
Can edit the metadata information, which does get sent to the client as XML ( how the image was processed, date, etc)<br />
<br />
can jpg compress the final output of the processing chain before serving it - for low bandwidth connections. you don't have to compress your base product - it remains very high resolution. You can use the compressed layer for most of your work and only show the full res product when zoomed in to a very small area.<br />
<br />
can be used to serve scanned cadastral drawings and have them projected to a known coordinate system. could be very important for counties without digital parcel gis systems to serve their cadastral information to the national map or state level portals such as NC OneMap.<br />
<br />
<br />
can load digital camera imagery and metadata (imu, xyx, etc) and with an existing terrain model, have the system do the orthorectification on the fly. great for disaster response situations where you do not have time to wait. you could have online orthos in a matter of days instead of months. we could have used that last fall after all the hurricane damage in western NC.<br />
<br />
imagery is not just used for a natural background. Analytical datasets and terrain models are imagery data. much vector data is extraced from imagery and imagery is quite often used for verification of vector data. the new image server will allow much imagery that languishes on disk or tape or in historic archives to be made immediately available to end users on their desktop without the huge overhead of pre-processing, georeferencing, orthorectification, etc.<br />
<br />
volume of acquired imagery is growing exponentially, we need systems to provide quick access that doesn't involve loading into a rdbms.<br />
<br />
value of imagery devalues quickly with time, but ironically it<br />
also increases in value again once more time has passed.<br />
<br />
paradigm shift merges the processing and distribution stages<br />
of the imagery.<br />
 nearly no pre-processing<br />
 quick to generate<br />
 very low latency<br />
 create multiple products from same source<br />
 can update very quickly<br />
 huge disk space savings<br />
 <br />
<B>More Demos</B><br />
<br />
how to create an image service:<br />
start catalog manager<br />
name the service<br />
add image(s) to the service (can add whole directories)<br />
set basic options<br />
compute statistics, generate overviews, metadata table &amp; footprints<br />
create the service<br />
<br />
can change other properties and processing chains (interpolation, <br />
crop method, transparency, compression, filters, georeferencing,<br />
pan sharpening, histograms, you name it...)<br />
<br />
<B>Data Flow</B><br />
<br />
input imagery<br />
process chaining<br />
compress<br />
display<br />
<br />
accepts many formats (1 to 32 bits per channel)<br />
 tif, geotif<br />
   jpg, lzw packbit<br />
   flat, scanline, tiled (optimal)<br />
   <br />
 bil, bsq, bip<br />
 jp2000, mrsid, ecw<br />
 nitf, hda img(GDAL) (USES GDAL [open source library for imagery - Ed.] INTERNALLY TO DO THE TRANSLATIONS!!!!)<br />
 sde raster<br />
 oracle georaster<br />
 <br />
there is an SDK so users can add their own image formats<br />
<br />
compression: store compressed or uncompressed  (preferable, disk is cheap)<br />
compression derived products on the fly for end users<br />
<br />
the input processing is applied to each individual image and<br />
can be different for each input image (radiometry). processing<br />
parameters can be stored in the process definition xml file or<br />
in the database, which is easier to manage for large image<br />
<br />
band extraction, band algebra for multiband imagery<br />
 321 true color, 742 false color ir, 432 near ir false color, nvdi, etc<br />
subsampling &amp; supersampling<br />
 near neighbor, cubic convolution, bicubic, weighted matrix<br />
transparency<br />
enhance &amp; sharpen<br />
  brightness, contrast, gamma, equalize, dynamic based on histogram<br />
  bit depth conversion - e.g. 18bit to 8bit<br />
sharpening: convolution filter on the primary data, before the<br />
 rest of the processing, whcih will give the best results<br />
<br />
enhancing and sharpening in combination can be used to allow<br />
you to better see into the shadows<br />
<br />
coordinate conversions<br />
<br />
pan sharpening - fusion of high res b/w imagery with lower res color<br />
<br />
mosaicking/merging<br />
  can feather sides or do a seamline mosaic, or a straight merge<br />
  <br />
<br />
can change the viewpoint at the client end to you can look at both aspect/sides of features (building obscurity) in  imagery with lots of building lean and lots of overlap. great for property assessors, security consultants, utility companies, etc.<br />
<br />
can specify "best-on-top" (most nadir), Zorder (fields in DB), or client defined order (based on sun angle or some other parameter<br />
of interest)<br />
<br />
client can lock the order they want.<br />
<br />
<B>Another Demo</B><br />
<br />
can "blur out" certain secure areas of imagery in one service for general public use and create a separate, secure imagery service for authorized use that does not blur out the sensitive features.<br />
<br />
can hillshade and render raw dem or srtm or lidar data on the fly. can also merge in pockets of higher res data, such as lidar data from state and county collection projects and create a composite elevation surface.<br />
<br />
You can create your own special processing, logo stamping on the imagery, interface to Hierarchical Data Storage, or payment gateways for credit card purchases.<br />
<br />
There are 3 special extensions:<br />
<br />
  ortho- 3d transform, orient data, terrain (image or image service) <br />
  <br />
  mosaic (feather, seamline detection)<br />
  <br />
  iCOMP - image compensation (trend removal on small scale <br />
       aerial photos, color balancing) is not available yet<br />
       <br />
<br />
Client Side can control coord system, subsystem, compression for transmission, locking image, mosaic method. The client can't create new services though, the admin has to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<B>Scalability</B><br />
<br />
can load balance between multiple servers<br />
MULTIPLE - Servers + DAS (direct access storage disk array - recommended!)<br />
  lots of cheap ide disks that are mirrored is the best route<br />
  <br />
Multiple - Server - NAS/SAN (not recommended, they aren't optimized for huge chunks of data pumped across the network, and it will kill your caching)<br />
  <br />
Cascading Servers - one service can request a subset of data from another service and do other processing on it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
managing derived images - creating overviews: <br />
 provide faster access by pre-processing<br />
 define by using the service manager<br />
 the server monitors every request that is made, and you can get the results of these as a shapefile of footprints, so you can get a better idea of your usage patterns and then adjust the amount of preprocessed imagery you provide to your users, so that certain high priority or high use areas can be stored as "tiles" and given a higher priority rating in the imagery metadata catalog so the image server will use this tile and not have to do on the fly processing for heavily trafficked areas.<br />
  <br />
 <br />
 client server arch. can do secured access. <br />
 works well with legacy applications because you don't have to convert your imagery.<br />
 <br />
 ANY ESRI app can be used as a client.<br />
 Other clients are ERDAS, MicroStation, AutoCad, Mapfinfo<br />
 **** OGC WMS, there is a programming API so you can [use WMS clients]<br />
  <br />
 can input into SDE raster, Oracle georaster<br />
 <br />
services are open (db tables and xml) and can be automated with scripting as new imagery comes in.<br />
 <br />
product called Image Server Publisher <br />
can't author new services, but allows orgs to make copies of a full server to clients or depts (mirror a server) can  be used on server farms, disaster failover sites.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
<B>SDE Raster vs Image Server</B><br />
  <br />
  db storage - file storage<br />
  img has no dbms licensing and no data loading and no preprocessing<br />
<br />
  **IF security is a big deal, a dbms is the better choice<br />
  <br />
  image server and SDE are complimentary, you can serve<br />
  sde raster layers with it.<br />
  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
<B>The Product</B><br />
<br />
server &amp; manager modules<br />
 service manager<br />
 client plugins (out of the box for previewing data)<br />
  desktop, engine, server, 3rd party, OGC WMS<br />
  <br />
 extensions (planned)<br />
  mosaic, orhto, iCOMP<br />
  <br />
  <br />
publisher version - read-only, lower price, no service manager<br />
<br />
<br />
pricing - $10,000 for a 2 cpu configuration<br />
available on its on release cycle, probably end of October<br />
<br />
<B>Q&A</B><br />
<br />
Q:can output go to other places than the client viewer?<br />
<br />
A:yes, can script to go to a ftp site or storage device<br />
service admin can control how much of the extraction<br />
by client users can happen.<br />
<br />
Q: speed comparisons between image server &amp; Sde raster<br />
for same area of imagery on same server type?<br />
A: no, not yet if you have thousands of users trying to access a final<br />
product, sde is better tuned for that scenario. GIS users<br />
and specialized fields such as security, emergency response,<br />
would benefit more from the image server.<br />
<br />
Q: OS support? <br />
A: Windows only now, soon a Linux version, later<br />
other OS's, such as Solaris.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you use oblique imagery from Pictometery? you can load it but the tools are not quite there yet for generating accurate measurements. The team is communicating with several vendors and hopes to offer support in later versions.<br />
<br />
Q: For client developers who are developing front ends to use<br />

<br />
There will be interface changes to the product to bring it into line with the ESRI look and feel. The service manager will not be part of ArcGIS immediately, but will be integrated into the family over time.<br />
<br />
Q: Multi-temporal imagery - how to handle different time series images for the same footprint area? <br />
A: you can define the Zorder field in your metadata catalog table and the client app can determine which Zorder field (latest, oldest, best sun angle, etc) to use during any working session.

Tuesday 8:30 session - ArcGIS Server - an Intro by Jeff Archer &amp; Eric Miller<br />
<br />
Server side web apps &amp; services for focused GIS tasks using ArcObjects. SOAP/XML, .Net and Java App Development Framework (ADF).<br />
<br />
You can use them to integrate full-function GIS capability into enterprise information systems. <br />
<br />
2 parts: ADF (Web controls, convenience classes, API), GIS Server that hosts server objects for use by web apps running within .Net and J2EE application servers.<br />
<br />
Unix now supported at 9.1 for Java<br />
<br />
Solaris 8.9  RedHad Enterprise 3 &amp; Suse Enterprise 9 Some windows support required - need ArcCatalog to administer and authentication must be on Windows PC.<br />
<br />
Spatial, 3D &amp; Network Analyst extension avail. (No Globe, must wait until 9.2), can do drive time and service area analysis now over the Web.<br />
<br />
Designed for enterprise implementations for distributed GIS access, GIS centric applications with advanced analysis functionality.<br />
Not really designed for map publishing - use ArcIMS for that.<br />
Good for short transaction editing and basic attribute update over the web - can reduce the need to manage many ArcGIS desktop installations for basic users. Great for centralizing GIS Functionality.<br />
<br />
Good for centralized services - gazateer, image and basemap services, route generation &amp; geocoding, proximity searches. easy to integrate into ERP systems, executive reporting. Good for embedding GIS into established workflows.<br />
<br />
<B>Soap/XML Web Services</B><br />
<br />
You can publish your own Soap/XML web services in a catalog and allow other developers in your organization to utilize these GIS services in all of their apps.<br />
<br />
Can consume output of other GIS web services in your apps too.<br />
<br />
Can do short or long transactions in geodatabase editing.<br />
Can checkout a version, save to personal geodb, make edits, then post edits back to SDE.<br />
<br />
Uses simple data types (strings, integers, etc.)<br />
<br />
Web services can chain multiple operations into a single processing chunk, or you can have multiple services and invoke them in your own processing order and present a final output map or list of attribute results.<br />
<br />
<B>ArcGIS Server Web Services</B><br />
<br />
Works with more complex data types using ArcObjects<br />
<br />
Can do advanced analysis such as cost surface or suitability modeling using spatial analyst over the web now.<br />
<br />
Templates are included in the ADF - one for geodatabase editing is included.<br />
<br />
Can be JSPs or ASP.Net Apps. <br />
<br />
Can add polygons to a geodb by digitizing on screen. <br />
<br />
Users can sketch in desired additions to their infrastructure as well as capturing existing.<br />
can embed workflow control and have mgrs log in and approve or reject redlined markups by employees and changes will be posted to geodb.<br />
<br />
Collaborative worklfow from distributed locations all going to the same geodb.<br />
<br />
Look for all the demos on the EDN website.<br />
<br />
<B>The Guts of GIS Server</B><br />
<br />
Collection of process that run in background to publish ArcObjects functionality.<br />
A webserver is needed.  MUST use ArcCatalog to administer ArcGIS Server.<br />
GIS Server can run across multiple machines.<br />
Can use thick desktop clients or web apps to access these.<br />
<br />
Server object manager (SOM) is the broker. <br />
<br />
Server Object Container (SOC) hosts the ArcObjects functionality. <br />
Similar to the ArcIMS spatial server.<br />
<br />
All services published support the SOAP Tooklit, can discover them and see all them methods in a Web browser with the right request.<br />
<br />
Powered by a multi threaded GIS engine with an extensive API, full<br />
geodatabase functionality and all the geometry models. Easy to install and administer - out of the box. Administer with ArcCatagog to start server objects, add new servers, load balance apps. You can build your own custom administration dashboards and do away w/ ArcCatalog.<br />
Takes full advantage of OS, .Net and Java security features, including easier to use controls. Works well w/ firewalls and windows integrated authentication. Provides a clean separation between client access to webserver and webserver access to the GIS server (multilayer security)<br />
ALL access to the GIS Server is authenticated.<br />
<br />
Very scaleable - supports pooling and distribution of server objects across machines and CPUS. can use a farm of low cost machines or a blade center.<br />
<br />
Supports WSDL - supports all the major Java App servers (Websphere, Weblogic,<br />
etc)<br />
No need to change app when adding new CPUs.<br />
<br />
Can host virtual IP addresses with ArcGIS server.<br />
<br />
Desktop ArcObjects code will run on the web except for UI components. You will have to build your own user interface.<br />
<br />
You will install the ADF runtime (proxies to ArcObjects) on the Web application server. They will contact the SOC on the GIS app server which will process and send results back to web app server.<br />
<br />
It can actually be a statefull connection for extended processing <br />
operations.<br />
<br />
9.1 objects types: (more types available in 9.2)<br />
<br />
Mapserver (describe display layers and maps, query, identify, analyze features,<br />
includes the geodatabase connection to the data itself.<br />
<br />
Geocode server objects: publish a desktop locator, supports standardization, address validation, single and batch geocoding, and reverse geocoding. You can create a custom locator object on the desktop and use with the geocoding service.<br />
<br />
Publishing methods - pooled and non-pooled. Pooled can limit number of instances (simple transaction model 1:M connection)<br />
<br />
Non pooled must be used for complex disconnected editing. 1:1 deeply<br />
stateful connection for long times.<br />
<br />
<B>Administer with ArcCatalog</B><br />
<br />
add SOM machine (GIS Server) to ArcCatalog. (can be local or internet)<br />
and add some or all of its available services. Set logging parameters<br />
and server oject startup time in secodns ( for slow geodb connections),<br />
hosts (extra SOC machines).Directores (where to route output on webserver),<br />
statistics (performance optimization diagnosis tool) <br />
set pooling parameters, manage processes, isolation mode, recycling properties<br />
(for recovering memory leaks)<br />
<br />
<B>Security</B><br />
<br />
service authentication to gis server<br />
authentication of GIS Server to all the resources it uses<br />
authenticatgion of ArcCatalog to access GIS Server<br />
<br />
GIS Server runs using a distinguished OS account. You should create an account for GIS Server so it can access SDE connections.<br />
<br />
agsuser group - any user who connects to ArcGIS server will have the same privleges as the arcgis server account. need to look at limiting the privileges of ArcGIS Server to minimum necessary.<br />
<br />
Can have anonymous users with authentication handled transparently inside the application if you don't want users to have to login. or can manage different levels of user groups for access.<br />
<br />
EDN - $1500 / yr subscription -  suggested for ArcGIS developers to get started. You can develop first, then deploy. You don't' get ArcGIS desktop with EDN, but you will need it. ESRI will convert existing developer seats to EDN subscriptions with cost reduction.<br />
<br />
You get the EDN resource binder with all product CDs, documentation<br />
library, (ENGINE devel kit &amp; runtime, Server .net &amp; Java ADFs, <br />
ArcIMS, SDE, ArcWeb Services)<br />
