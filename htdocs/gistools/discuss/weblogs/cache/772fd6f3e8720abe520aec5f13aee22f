<p>The OpenStreetMap project started off in the UK because Ordnance Survey was so restrictive over the use of their data, so this has been a great win for the project, though the release of the data doesn't make the project any less likely to continue. This is partly because of the project's aim to create an open map (and open map data) for the whole world, and partly because in many parts of the UK, OpenStreetMap actually surpasses the level of detail that Ordnance Survey has released as part of their OpenData package. </p>
<p>Where the Ordnance Survey data comes in very useful for the OpenStreetMap project is in areas where we don't (yet) have much map data, as well as for areas where we do have a lot of data, for checking that our data is accurate and complete.</p>
<p>A little while ago I noticed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvey_Island">Canvey Island</a> hadn't had much attention in OpenStreetMap, with just a few roads that had been added by a couple of users over the past two years or so. Curious about the place (and for some reason, partially imagining it to be a little like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island">Coney Island</a> in New York) I started to read a little about it, and thought about visiting, but the more I looked at it, the more I wanted to fill in the map. The result is below.</p>

<p>The OS OpenData allowed me to add roads (and most of their names), museums, libraries, pubs, schools, churches, camp sites, caravan sites, chalet villages and some natural features. Where things on the OS map didn't show names, it was often possible to pick these up from photos on the excellent <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk">Geograph</a> project and from other research on the internet. </p>
<p>Once I'd got most of the tracing work done, I also got in touch with the two local contributors I had identified, one of which got back to me straight away (despite not editing the map since last year some time), and added in any extra information he could, such as the extent of parks and recreation grounds.</p>
<p>I think this is a great example of one open data project being advanced by the availability of data from other sources and projects.</p>
<p>If you want to help mapping an area (it's probably best to improve the map in areas that you know rather than mapping an area like this that you don't know that well...), just follow the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_Opendata#OS_StreetView">instructions on the OpenStreetMap wiki</a>.</p>

Having released their latest version though, OffMaps now provides much more functionality in the form of a local guide to businesses, services and attractions, and access to Wikipedia articles about the places around you.</p>
<p>Now, if you're looking for a bar, cafe, restaurant, museum, tourist attraction - or, in theory, anything else - you need look no further than the guide in <a href="http://www.offmaps.com">OffMaps</a>. It'll show you its location, give you their address and phone number (though there aren't many of these yet) and link you through to their website if they have one. Note that not everything is in there, and in particular it's lacking in the shops it covers, as well as in some other areas.</p>

<p><em>Note: the app is currently only listing things in certain chosen categories, so if your business falls outside of those categories it may not show up in the guide. You're still free to add your listing to OpenStreetMap though, as it could be used in the future either in OffMaps or in any other application.</em></p>

<p>The British Government is now starting to see the benefit of opening up data though, and I'm particularly happy to see the <a href="http://www.ordnancysurvey.gov.uk">Ordnance Survey</a> looking to <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2009/nov2009/mappingfuture.html">make more data available</a> to the public. All of which should stimulate innovation even further as it starts to make information available that was previously locked up in only commercially available datasets. </p>
<p>Related to this overall effort, the OS is currently promoting their <a href="http://www.geovation.org.uk">GeoVation Challenge</a> to encourage people to share their ideas for geographic innovation. There is even money up for grabs for the best business ideas proposed, designed to help get those ideas to market.</p>
<p>So, if you have ideas for map-based or generally geographic things you'd like to see developed, but don't have the time or knowledge to do it yourself, you can share them in the <a href="https://challenge.geovation.org.uk/ideas">GeoVation Ideas Challenge</a> and be in with a chance of a tour around the OS headquarters in Southampton (an interesting visit if you get the chance). On the other hand, if you have a business idea, and are prepared to put the work in to get it going, you can share your idea in the <a href="https://challenge.geovation.org.uk/ventures">GeoVation Awards Challenge</a> and be in with a chance to win up to £10,000 to help get your venture off the ground.</p>
<p>If you're interested in taking part, you will need to act fast as the closing date for entries is 4 January 2010. Best of luck!</p>
