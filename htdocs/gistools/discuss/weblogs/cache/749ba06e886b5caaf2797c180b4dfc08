<p>With yesterday&#8217;s first-ever National Methamphetamine Awareness Day, the National Association of Counties (NACo) has again urged Congress to enact pending legislation and provide adequate funding to help communities and families cope with the effects of this highly addictive and dangerous drug.</p>
<p>Specifically, NACo urges Congress to: (1) Provide $1.1 billion for the Justice Assistance Grant program, which helps local governments establish anti-drug taskforces as well as support community treatment and prevention programs; (2) Pass S. 2019, the Meth Remediation Research Act of 2005, sponsored by Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), which is currently being held up by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.); (3) Pass the House level of $1.8 billion for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant; and (4) Urges Congress to tighten the international market for bulk pseudoephedrine to help curb the import of meth into the U.S. from Mexican superlabs. <a id="more-1831"></a></p>
<p>NACo has taken a leadership role in fighting meth abuse in America with the release of five national surveys. The most recent survey in July 2006 found that county law enforcement officials across 44 states reported that methamphetamine remains the number one drug problem in their county.</p>
<p>NACo applauds U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for establishing National Methamphetamine Awareness Day and pledges to continue working with the Department of Justice and Congress to curb the meth epidemic in America.

<p>I hope that World AIDS Day, December 1, 2006, will serve as a reminder to people across the globe of the importance of getting tested for HIV and knowing one’s status.  Making an HIV test part of a routine physical exam is an important step toward improving treatment of HIV/AIDS patients and stopping the spread of the disease.  By identifying HIV-positive individuals sooner, doctors can provide patients with better access to life-saving and life-extending care.</p>
<p>For so long, we could only treat the symptoms of AIDS and provide comfort to the dying.  Today, we have the ability to fight back against HIV itself.  We have medicines that can effectively halt the evolution of HIV and help people live normal lives.<a id="more-1829"></a></p>
<p>The nature of the epidemic in the United States has changed drastically over the last 25 years, since HIV/AIDS was first diagnosed, and the way the government funds treatment for the disease must reflect these changes.</p>
<p>More and more women, minorities, and people in the South and rural areas are being infected with HIV/AIDS.  Recognizing this, I have worked with Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) on a bill to modernize and strengthen our domestic response to HIV/AIDS, the Ryan White CARE Act, to ensure that Americans in need can receive access to treatment and prevention, regardless of their gender, race, or where they live.</p>
<p>I also look forward to working with my colleagues in the next Congress to evaluate and strengthen our global response to this disease.  We have the technology and know-how to stop AIDS from killing people and destroying families.  We need to employ this technology and know-how in the best, most efficient manner possible.</p>
<p>Though we have made tremendous strides in the last several years, the task before us remains daunting, as these statistics on HIV/AIDS from the United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAIDS) reveal:</p>
<p>Approximately 40 million, and perhaps as many 47.1 million, people in the world are living with HIV/AIDS.<br />
4.3 million new HIV/AIDS cases were diagnosed in 2006.<br />
2.9 million people died of AIDS in 2006.<br />
More than 25 million people have died of AIDS since 1981.</p>
<p>In developing countries 6.8 million people are in immediate need of life-saving AIDS drugs, but only 1.65 million are receiving treatment.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa has been struck hardest by the epidemic, with 24.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS, a 5.9 percent prevalence rate in the adult population, and 2.1 million AIDS deaths in 2006. Africa has 12 million AIDS orphans.</p>
<p>This is a global problem that requires a global solution.  We must all do more to raise awareness and halt the spread of this deadly disease.
