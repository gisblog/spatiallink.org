While you won't get as much sleep as usual during <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org">FOSS4G 2011 Denver</a>, you'll still want to get a place to stay - for the internet of course!  
</p>
<p>
I visited the <a href="http://www.sheratondenverdowntown.com/">Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel</a> last week and had a peek in the guest rooms that are <a href="http://www.starwoodmeeting.com/StarGroupsWeb/booking/reservation?id=1011161053&key=AC6C9"> part of our package</a>.  They were all very nice and comfortable.  
</p>
<p>
But more importantly, our arrangement with Sheraton also includes free internet in the guest rooms (~$15/day value).  Add to that the location, upstairs from the FOSS4G meeting rooms, and you'll find it a great place to stay.  It is centrally located for all activities in the downtown area.
</p>
<p>
The primary rooms we have reserved include a single king bed or two queen beds in a larger room.

A recent comment was passed along to me suggesting we need to be able to accept micro-donations.  Those are donations from anyone except those who use the sponsorship programs.  
</p><p>
The good news is we can do it already and have been able to for a while!  
</p><p>
Here is a brief overview of the various donation and sponsorship opportunities that exist at OSGeo.  Have some special way you want to give something?  Drop me a note and we can talk about it.
</p>
<h3> Donate Button </h3>
<p>We have a PayPal "Donate" button on the front page of OSGeo.org.  Donors can contribute <b>any amount</b>!
</p><p>
<center>
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="B3JT7BC4W8PNU">
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/WEBSCR-640-20110401-1/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/WEBSCR-640-20110401-1/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1">
</form>
</center>
</p><p>
You can also <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=B3JT7BC4W8PNU">use this URL</a> to accomplish the same thing but using email.
</p><p>
We also have a bank account you can direct deposit or wire funds too, though for small amounts most won't want to do this - email me if you do.
</p>
<h3>Focused Marketing Funding</h3>
<p>
Local Chapters, and friends, around the world help take OSGeo before more audiences than we know of.  You can help them directly by offering to fund many different things, some may only cost $100 or less, others in the thousands: purchase a booth at an industry tradeshow, donate a speaking slot at an event, fund printing of brochures, pay for a printed pop-up banner and more.  For some ideas of the kind of marketing material available see <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Marketing_Material_Samples">this wiki page</a>
</p><p>
You can pay for the purchase directly yourself, or offer to do it through a Local Chapter.  Alternately, OSGeo HQ can take help if needed.  I have an account with a "cloud-based printing" company from which I can order material and have it printed and shipped locally around the world.  If you want to make a donation to fund something in particular, use the donate button and drop me a note.
</p>
<h3>Meeting Space</h3>
<p>
Local Chapters may also need someone to just simply donate meeting space.  Having a Friday afternoon meet-up at a restaurant is fun, but sometimes a boardroom with projector can really be all that it takes to help a Chapter grow.  If you have a room, offer it up, get the kudos (and good P.R.) and help make a difference without having to spend a cent.
</p><p>
Likewise, Local Chapters are often heavily involved in running events (including <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/program">FOSS4G</a>).  The two largest costs to running an event are usually <b>food</b> and <b>meeting space</b>.  If you can help with either of these you will be a great asset and worthy of much praise!
</p><p>
I'll do a follow up post on the other ways you can donate but before I sign off please take a moment to <a href="http://osgeo.org/sponsors"> check out our <b>Sponsors</b> page</a> to see the great sponsors that help make the larger funding happen.  Their funding has gone toward a hundred different things including: buying booth space, giving OSGeo a presence at events, funding printed material, duplicating <a href="http://live.osgeo.org">OSGeo Live DVDs</a>, keeping web services lights on and helping keep our annual events going.  Our sponsors are at the forefront of helping fund all our bigger efforts.  Thanks a lot!
</p>

<p>The first question just asked if they were good ideas and the results were all pretty much positive - but with Academic development coming out on top with the highest number of &quot;this is important&quot; votes.</p>

<p>The second question forced voters to make a decision and rank the ideas from least to most important.  Again, Academic development came out on top.  I'll crunch some more stats later, but thought you might find this graph interesting.  Sorry if you don't like 6 axis graphs :)</p>

Note the larger the gap between the red and blue lines on an axis shows a greater difference in voting preference.  The two rings represent 50% and 100% of votes.</p>

<p>Even from this perspective it shows a very strong support for the academic idea, with Government in second.  Then Open Standards and Open Data.</p>

<p><em>The organizing committee has been working away on various tasks for next September’s FOSS4G conference in Denver. We now have sponsorship details sorted out – you can download the brochure at <a href="http://bit.ly/gbWbey">http://bit.ly/gbWbey</a> (PDF). We are offering a 10% discount for any sponsors who commit by the end of January.</p>

<p>We also have a winner in our logo contest, which you can see at our web site which is now up at <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/">http://2011.foss4g.org/</a>. We had over 800 votes in total, thanks to everyone who voted! The logo design was an interesting process.  Creating a logo is always tricky because you have as many different opinions as people involved in the process! We used a site called <a href="http://crowdspring.com">crowdspring</a>, as you will know if you voted – multiple people compete to create your logo, which we found worked very well. And then they also have a voting process you can use if you like, which I found very helpful to choose a winner from the multiple good entries.</p>

<p>And as mentioned above, our web site is now up and running - it will have a lot more content added to it over the coming weeks. But check out the <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/timetable/">timetable</a> leading up to the conference – some significant items coming up are the call for workshops which will be out in mid January, and the call for papers which will be out at the beginning of February.</p>

But check out the <a href="http://2011.foss4g.org/timetable/">timetable</a> leading up to the conference – some significant items coming up are the call for workshops which will be out in mid January, and the call for papers which will be out at the beginning of February.</p>

It was a great time of connecting with so many people that it exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>Before heading up to Nottingham I was able to meet up with Martin Daly from Cadcorp (a GDAL/OGR sponsor) in London.  We hadn't met face to face before, so I was glad to get a firsthand chance to see their SIS GIS Desktop product in action.  Our very own Mateusz also works there so it was treat to catch up with him as well.  Of course he couldn't resist going to Nottingham too and overworking his camera - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mloskot/sets/72157620410984670/">his flickr feed</a> is always helpful after an event :)</p>

<p>From the word go, Suchith Anand, Mike Jackson and the rest of the University of Nottingham's <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/cgs/">Centre for Geospatial Science</a> crew had us hopping.  I didn't realise it was possible to pack so much into a single day event!  Thank you for the opportunity to deliver a keynote there and for lining up so many good speakers and people to meet with the following day as well.  Three cheers!  I'm sure next year will be even better.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2468/3654724029_8a6a5a9ee6.jpg" alt="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2468/3654724029_8a6a5a9ee6.jpg" title="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2468/3654724029_8a6a5a9ee6.jpg" /><!-- http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2468/3654724029_8a6a5a9ee6.jpg --></p>

<p>It was a truly international event with close to 20 different countries represented.  It was really good to catch up with many of you from all over Europe, I'll be going through my notes this week, but still feel free to drop me if you remember anything in particular we should pursue together.</p>

<p>One recurring theme of interest from several groups and and individuals, was the interest to partner with OSGeo to write case studies relating to their domain.  I'm really looking forward to following up on these.  If you want to help write, please let me know.</p>

<p>The OSGeo UK Chapter held a meeting as well, with <a href="http://www.archaeogeek.com/blog/">Jo Cook</a> leading the charge.  It's always fascinating to see how different each chapter is - each with their own interests, strengths and local challenges.  This was only the second time they met...sort of.  Last year there were less than a dozen who met up to discuss the idea of forming a chapter.  This year it was more like 50 or more people with broad interest from around the UK.  Coming from a Canadian, it might seem strange to say that the UK chapter is spread out over large distances, but it is large enough that some more regional local groups are likely to pop up.  There were contingents from <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</a> and Wales talking about meeting and I know there are some Irish interested as well.</p>

<p>They have high hopes, so if you are the UK, <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk">join their list</a> and find a good reason to get together and chat.</p>

If you see an opportunity to work together on any of them, or if you want to find a reason to get together, drop me a note.</p>


<h2 id="toc2">Journal and Annual Report</h2>
<br />
As many of you already know, the <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Annual_Report_2008">OSGeo Annual Report compilation</a> is underway.  With a few days left to get reports in, I hope you will pester others in your project steering committee or local chapter to submit something - even something very brief.  OSGeo has been pretty light on reporting requirements, so this annual requirement shouldn't be too much effort.  In fact, I think it very beneficial for our groups to take a moment to reflect and consider how they've progressed during 2008. When compilation is complete, then it will be rolled together with a few other articles into OSGeo Journal Volume 5.  Watch for it later in the month.  <p>If you have extra time on your hands and want to help edit upcoming issues of the journal - join the <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/newsletter">Journal mailing list</a> and introduce yourself.  We're moving to a powerful online management system called the <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs">Open Journal System</a>.  It's taking some getting used to, but will really help make it possible to undertake peer review and easier submission/management between different editors.</p>


<h2 id="toc3">Marketing</h2>
<br />
As noted in previous posts we have several projects on the go.  The one that's mostly on my plate is to oversee getting design work completed for some brochures, templates and other items that are in high demand by local chapters and events worldwide.  The aim is to have reusable file formats and ones that are easily edited or updated in the future.  Watch for more on this in the upcoming month.<p>This month several of us had the opportunity to contribute to the <a href="http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/issue/view/83">Open Source Business Resource</a> Journal.  Edited by Dave McIlhagga, including contributions by myself, Paul Ramsey, Mark Lucas, Scott Bortman, Andrew Ross, Haris Kurtagic and Geoff Zeiss.  Good work guys and thank you to the OSBR for the great opportunity.</p>

<p>OSGeo will have a booth at the (huge) upcoming <a href="http://aag.org/annualmeetings/2009/index.htm">American Association of Geographers</a> (AAG) event 22-26 March.  Thanks to Alex Mandel for taking the lead on organising this with his colleagues at UC Davis.  Also to the other volunteers who are helping speak and maintain our presence there.</p>

<p>Paul Ramsey is also helping to organise our presence at <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009">O'Reilly's Where 2.0 event</a> 19-21 May.  There is always a stellar line-up of folks who are friends of OSGeo and our relatives.  I'm not sure if I'll be attending, but if you are going to be then you might want to mention it on the <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss">OSGeo Discuss list</a> to see who else is going.</p>


<h3 id="toc4">Supporting Your Event</h3>
<br />
I'm always wary of giving a false sense of hope, but if you know of a critical event in your region or domain that OSGeo could make a splash at in the future - please join the <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/marketing">Marketing mailing list</a> and introduce your idea.  We don't really sponsor events, but we do expect to help with a few different ones - usually not through sponsoring but through exhibiting, speaking or generally helping spread OSGeo project information.<p>One warning though, be prepared to help organise or develop the idea if you really want to see it happen.  The Marketing group is focused this year on developing the material mentioned above, and making sure this gets into the hands of as many people as possible who will be at events around the world.</p>


<h2 id="toc5">Sponsorship</h2>
<br />
This is the time of year where several of our esteemed <a href="http://osgeo.org">OSGeo Sponsors</a> come up for renewal, so I've had my head in the books a bit more than usual this past month.  On the topic of sponsors, if you ever have any suggestions for sponsors that are a good fit for OSGeo (or any of the projects that are underway), I'd love to hear about it.  We can chat about it, or you can drop me an email to get the ball rolling.
<h2 id="toc6">Events and Meetings</h2>
<br />
In a few months it will be about one year of reduced travel at my end.  My wife had a nasty knee injury, but her surgery has worked out great.  Now I'm starting to get any speaking opportunities and meetings lined up for later in the spring/summer.  <br />
<ul>
    <li> The next event I am planning to attend is the <strong><a href="http://www.opensourcegis.org.uk/">First Open Source GIS UK Conference</a></strong> in Nottingham, June 22nd.  I have several opportunities for talks and meetings that are starting to line up.  If you are nearby (e.g. anywhere in the UK) and would like to meet, please let me know, I'm always keen to see what people are doing with OSGeo software, local chapters, education and more.</li>
    <li> <strong><a href="http://geowebconference.org/">GeoWeb Vancouver</a></strong> is a great place to meet up with several OSGeo people.  I expect to attend there in July and look forward to seeing others.</li>
    <li> <strong><a href="http://foss4g2009.org">FOSS4G Sydney</a></strong> of course... 20-23 Oct.  The marketing group is just starting to talk about preparing for an OSGeo booth there.  If you are interested in helping coordinate our exhibition floor presence, get a front and centre visible position, etc... there is an opportunity to help.  Prior experience with such an effort would be ideal.</li>
</ul>

<p>What else is on your agenda that I should attend or could help with in some way?  I'm sure I've forgotten more than I remember!</p>

<h2 id="toc7">Local Chapter Logo Usage</h2>
<br />
Recently a few local chapters were wondering about how they could use the OSGeo logo and customise it for their local use.  Historically, the guidelines for using the main logo have prevented alteration of the logo.  Yet there was recent work done that would allow additional text describing the logos purpose:<br />
<img src="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_project.png" alt="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_project.png" title="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_project.png" /><!-- http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_project.png --> <img src="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_sustaining.png" alt="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_sustaining.png" title="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_sustaining.png" /><!-- http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_sustaining.png --> <img src="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_incubation.png" alt="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_incubation.png" title="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_incubation.png" /><!-- http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/marketing/logo/png24/125/OSGeo_incubation.png --><p>These were primarily for users and projects to stamp on their web pages to easy identification back to OSGeo.  But some local chapters are interested in doing more and taking parts of the main logo and incorporating them into their local version.   Others are only interested in changing the text under the logo so it reflects the local chapter name, for example with the Japan chapter's rendition.<br />
<img src="http://www.osgeo.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/ambient-glo-1/images/logo.png" alt="http://www.osgeo.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/ambient-glo-1/images/logo.png" title="http://www.osgeo.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/ambient-glo-1/images/logo.png" /><!-- http://www.osgeo.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/ambient-glo-1/images/logo.png --></p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, the Australia-New Zealand chapter has a beautiful rendition of a logo based roughly on the shape and colours of the previous OSGeo logo, though not really remixing the logo in a new way.  It's more unique than it is a remix.<br />
<img src="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/4/4a/OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png/180px-OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png" alt="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/4/4a/OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png/180px-OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png" title="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/4/4a/OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png/180px-OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png" /><!-- http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/4/4a/OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png/180px-OSGeo_Aust_NZ_Logo.png --></p>

<p>There are several more interesting examples out there that bring up the main questions.  For example the FOSSGIS German group is mixing the OSGeo compass symbol into various renditions, helping to bring together elements from their past.  See <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSSGIS_e.V._Logo_Wettbewerb">here</a>.  <br />
<img src="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/2/2c/Fossgis_draft_c.png/200px-Fossgis_draft_c.png" alt="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/2/2c/Fossgis_draft_c.png/200px-Fossgis_draft_c.png" title="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/2/2c/Fossgis_draft_c.png/200px-Fossgis_draft_c.png" /><!-- http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/2/2c/Fossgis_draft_c.png/200px-Fossgis_draft_c.png --> <img src="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/c/ca/FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png/187px-FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png" alt="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/c/ca/FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png/187px-FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png" title="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/c/ca/FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png/187px-FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png" /><!-- http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/c/ca/FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png/187px-FOSSGIS_eV_prototype.png --></p>

<p>The question of logo usage has two faces.  First a local chapter may always have their own unique logo - there is no restriction on this specifically and local chapters are encouraged to do their own branding and to use the OSGeo logo as part of it.  The main question then is whether or not a local chapter (or project) should be allowed to use <strong>elements of the OSGeo logo</strong> and remix them for their purposes, as in the FOSSGIS example.</p>

<p>The Marketing mailing list had some discussion on this <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/marketing/2009-January/002104.html">earlier in the month</a>.  One side of the discussion ( <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/marketing/2009-January/002129.html">here</a> ) gave some encouragement for loosening restrictions and several were in agreement.  The main point being that free and open use and mixing of the logo should be seen a strength to our community - people like parts of graphics then let them use it since it doesn't detract from the main usage of the local in formal contexts.</p>

<p>The opposing view is centred around our <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/content/foundation/legal/trademark_guidelines.html">trademark guidelines</a> which seeks to protect the OSGeo brand from confusion and dilution.  As one of OSGeo primary brand identifiers it is argued that it should not be used lightly or modified without approval.  The core question then becomes whether OSGeo should relax the trademark guidelines or not.</p>

<p>Those discussing it during our last meeting were in agreement with loosening restrictions, with the expectation that local chapters would use their logo (in whatever form) when talking about their chapter, but when referring back to OSGeo in particular the main OSGeo logo would be logical to use.  In some context it would make sense to use both logos - e.g. a news items or event poster - and would not necessarily dilute the main brand.</p>

<p>Further discussion was deferred back to the list to seek a consensus view.  The main documents that would needs some attention are the trademark guidelines but also some direction for usage in the <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Local_Chapter_Guidelines">local chapter guidelines</a>.</p>


<h2 id="toc8">Assign Leads for 2009 Projects</h2>
<br />
The 2009 Marketing Budget approved last year identifies several of the main projects for the marketing committee.  To help ensure some progress on each item, we discussed who might be interested in helping lead/coordinate each component.  The hope here is to delegate responsibilities to members of the committee or community who would like to help see the project move along.  Then others can join with them to help were they are interested.  Everyone present at the meeting offered to take on a part:<br />
<ul>
    <li> Communication and Branding - next stage of branding development and design. <strong>Tyler</strong> or other who is interested</li>
    <li> Website Redesign - co-ordinating with webcom, overseeing project with designers. <strong>Daniele</strong> with support from Cameron, Wolf, Jeroen.</li>
    <li> Material Production - overseeing production based on above branding development. <strong>Jeroen</strong></li>
    <li> Exhibition Pack Prototype - following status of very parts of planning, development and production.  <strong>Alex</strong> also coordinating with Tyler re #1 and #3 above.</li>
    <li> Event Support - reaching out to identify or find upcoming event opportunities. <strong>Cameron</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Each person will help pull together a work plan and invite others to join in, as well as give a report at the next marketing meeting.  If you are particularly interested in one area, please contact the person above or mention it on the Marketing mailing list.<br />
