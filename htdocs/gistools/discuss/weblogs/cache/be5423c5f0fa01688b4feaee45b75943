In the past few experiments using WPF terrain meshes I've made use of scrollbar bindings to manipulate 
the scene. Although this is satisfactory for experimental proof of concept it remains an obstacle 
for flying through a 3D scene. This week I finally built a flying camera with instrument controls 
for throttle, banking, and tilting which lets me fly my camera around in the model and swivel its 
LookDirection with a gimbal tool.

		After last week's import of SketchUp building models into WPF xbap, I decided it was time to work with some the higher resolution DEM data available from the USGS. The USGS has been upgrading a number of quads to 10m DEMs. These are scattered over the US and provide 9x number of points for building TIN models for select areas than the older 30m DEM. Much of the updating is in the western states which have a good deal of relief to model. After adding context terrain it is then a simple matter to add a planar water surface bound to an adjustable scroll bar.

							 I went to a little promotional seminar in Denver for Google Enterprise. The seminar was mostly marketing Power Points, but the coffee was good and the demonstration pods afterwards were interesting. I have not played much with Sketchup since it was first introduced. The demo overview got me interested again. Once I got back to the office I downloaded the most recent trial version for some experimenting. Sketchup is really an easy to learn tool, at least compared to AutoCAD. It would probably take a week or so to get very proficient but that is really a short time considering the hastle of entering 3D models.</br ></br>

JAXB is a tool for processing xml files in Java. The JAXB
xjc compiler converts an XML schema file, .xsd, into a set of Java classes that
match the hierarchy of the schema. Once these classes are available, an xml file
based on the original schema can then be mapped directly into Java classes where it
can be used in your program using the jaxb api.

This is an appealing concept since it makes processing xml
files in Java much easier than the two alternate routes of either 

A. creating custom SAX content
handlers or 
B. traversing an in memory DOM tree.

This is so appealing in fact that I thought I would try it

The OGC has established itself very much as a standards only body, so there is room for a GIS Web services open source body.
Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what that should look like. 
GIS sees itself differentiated enough to assume a separate identity from a more generic community such as Apache.
The PostGIS/GeoServer/uDig/MapBuilder group has a lot of momentum in the Java services space developing to strictly OpenGIS standards.
PostGIS fits more in PostgreSQL community but some of the committers seem to overlap at Refractions with GeoServer and uDig. GeoServer is a 
nice Java alternative to MapServer, while uDig fits into the Eclipse community but overlaps the GeoServer/PostGIS. MapBuilder is on the client 
side entirely and would work with either MapServer or GeoServer. So there appear to be a lot of overlapping communities involved.

 Web feature Service, WFS, is the logical extension of the prior Web Map Service, WMS, specification from the Open Geospatial Consortium, OGC. Apart from the questionable proliferation of acronyms, there is a real reason for this. WMS deals with distribution of raster while WFS pushes out vectors. WMS rasters of course may be and often are the result of underlying stores of vectors, but the client sees only the pixel result. On the other hand WFS pushes out the more fundamental mathematics of geometry in the form of another acronym, GML or Geographic Markup Language. The utility of geometry on the client side may be in question, especially in the html world where vectors reside as second class or less citizens. However, a further acronym, SVG, Scalable Vector Graphics, adds vector rendering to the humble browser opening a new window for graphic clients.

 Web feature Service, WFS, is the logical extension of the prior Web Map Service, WMS, specification from the Open Geospatial Consortium, OGC. Apart from the questionable proliferation of acronyms, there is a real reason for this. WMS deals with distribution of raster while WFS pushes out vectors. WMS rasters of course may be and often are the result of underlying stores of vectors, but the client sees only the pixel result. On the other hand WFS pushes out the more fundamental mathematics of geometry in the form of another acronym, GML or Geographic Markup Language.
