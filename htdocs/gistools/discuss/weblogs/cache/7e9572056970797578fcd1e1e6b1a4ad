The vast majority of my time the past 8 months has been dedicated to building our Cloud Services infrastructure but a lot of other updates have occurred as well. </p><p><strong>Arc2Earth Reseller Program</strong> &ndash; Last year we started a&nbsp;reseller program and are quite happy with the companies&nbsp;that have&nbsp;signed up to help us distribute A2E. A lot of work went into this process and we&rsquo;re thankful for all those who helped out in the process. I&rsquo;d really like to thank the following companies who jumped on board quickly and in some cases, have devoted serious amounts of time and effort in the marketing and sales of A2E. </p><p><strong>United States</strong></p><li>Allen Instruments - Scottsdale, Arizona - <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/controlpanel/blogs/http/www.alleninstruments.com">http//www.alleninstruments.com</a></li><li>GeoSpatial Training Service - San Antonio, Texas - <a href="http://www.geospatialtraining.com/">http://www.geospatialtraining.com/</a></li><li>New Light Technologies - Washington D.C. - <a href="http://www.newlighttechnologies.com/">http://www.newlighttechnologies.com/</a></li><li>Zekiah Technologies - LaPlata, Maryland - <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/">http://www.zekiah.com/</a></li><ul></ul><strong>Europe, Middle East and Africa</strong> <ul><li>Mapping Anywhere SARL - France - <a href="http://www.mappinganywhere.com/">http://www.mappinganywhere.com/</a></li></ul><p>more information will be available at this link as the program advances: <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/controlpanel/blogs/&rsquo;">Arc2Earth Resellers</a> </p><p><strong>Arc2Earth Version 2.1</strong> - Last month we released V2.1 of the A2E, it contains lots of new features and bug fixes. You can download the Trial version by <a href="http://www.arc2earth.net/cs">visiting our user forum</a>, creating an account and then going to the Downloads section. The online <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/support/ChangeLog.txt">change log</a> is available here and you can see a list of reasons why you might want to use Arc2Earth versus ArcGIS 9.3 native KML Exporter. Version 2.1 will have several more patches before Version 2.2 which contains the UI for creating and consuming Arc2Earth Cloud Services </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Arc2Earth Cloud Services</strong> - Wow, so much has changed since we <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2008/07/31/Arc2Earth-Services.aspx">first announced</a> work on the Cloud last July. The intent and vision is the same but both technical hurdles and feature creep have slightly delayed our public beta. That being said, I am incredibly excited about this service and what it will enable our users to accomplish, I can&rsquo;t wait to get it into their hands. </p><p><strong>Update</strong> - Added some <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2009/01/22/Arc2Earth-Cloud-Services-_2D00_-Upload.aspx">quick videos here</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>here&rsquo;s a quick peak: </p><p><em>ArcMap Integration</em> &ndash; create and edit your maps directly from ArcMap using some new A2E toolbars and windows. You can add &ldquo;cloud layers&rdquo; directly to your local map and then use the native editing tools in ArcMap to make changes. Every resource in your cloud instance is controlled by login and ACL lists so you can create groups users who all work remotely on the live data. There are also bulk upload/download tools so you can get a fresh copy of any layer anytime you need to perform heavy lifting GIS analysis. </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/A2E_CloudExplorer_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/A2E_CloudExplorer.png">Larger Image</a></p><p><em></em></p><p><em>KML</em> &ndash; The KML engine used in the service can be applied to any resource that serves features. There are a couple of endpoints where KML can be returned but in the samples below, it is the&nbsp;&quot;search&quot; resource.&nbsp;All aspects of the KML (labeling, balloon templates, styling, height, filtering etc)&nbsp;are applied at runtime and streamed out. In general, Arc2Earth will always be able to create and serve static files but the focus in the Cloud is the dynamic creation of KML. What&rsquo;s even better is that any of these endpoints support REST parameters that allow you to control this from the client. For instance, here are four different representations of the same proximity search: </p><p>HTML View </p><p>&nbsp;<img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_html_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_html.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>KML View &ndash; just labels applied </p><p>.../Demographics/StarbucksWorld/MapServer/0/search?q=near(Midtown,+NYC,+1mi)&amp;limit=20&amp;f=kml&amp;p={&quot;label&quot;:&quot;[!address]&quot;} </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_label_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_label.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>KML View &ndash; Simple Renderer, 3D Marker Symbols </p><p>.../Demographics/StarbucksWorld/MapServer/0/search?q=near(Midtown,+NYC,+1mi)&amp;limit=20&amp;f=km &amp;p={&quot;rend&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple&quot;,&quot;symbol&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:{&quot;html&quot;:&quot;FF00FF&quot;},&quot;scale&quot;:15}}} </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_model_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_model.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>KML View &ndash; Class Breaks Renderer on distance, 3D Marker Symbols </p><p>.../Demographics/StarbucksWorld/MapServer/0/search?q=near(Midtown,+NYC,+1mi)&amp;limit=30&amp;f=kml &amp;p={&quot;rend&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;ClassBreaks&quot;,&quot;field&quot;:&quot;distance&quot;,&quot;breaks&quot;:[150,500,1500],&quot;symbols&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;FF00FF&quot;,&quot;scale&quot;:25},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;FFFF00&quot;,&quot;scale&quot;:15},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;0000FF&quot;,&quot;scale&quot;:5}]}} </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_cb_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_cb.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>While it is very useful for one off links or scripting, sending json via the query string can be an issue so any of these can also be accessed by url as well. Taken to its extreme, we use the KML Rest API to create a Google Earth viewer for every map and layer.

The vast majority of my time the past 8 months has been dedicated to building our Cloud Services infrastructure but a lot of other updates have occurred as well. </p><p><strong>Arc2Earth Reseller Program</strong> &ndash; Last year we started a&nbsp;reseller program and are quite happy with the companies&nbsp;that have&nbsp;signed up to help us distribute A2E. A lot of work went into this process and we&rsquo;re thankful for all those who helped out in the process. I&rsquo;d really like to thank the following companies who jumped on board quickly and in some cases, have devoted serious amounts of time and effort in the marketing and sales of A2E. </p><p><strong>United States</strong></p><li>Allen Instruments - Scottsdale, Arizona - <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/controlpanel/blogs/http/www.alleninstruments.com">http//www.alleninstruments.com</a></li><li>GeoSpatial Training Service - San Antonio, Texas - <a href="http://www.geospatialtraining.com/">http://www.geospatialtraining.com/</a></li><li>New Light Technologies - Washington D.C. - <a href="http://www.newlighttechnologies.com/">http://www.newlighttechnologies.com/</a></li><li>Zekiah Technologies - LaPlata, Maryland - <a href="http://www.zekiah.com/">http://www.zekiah.com/</a></li><ul></ul><strong>Europe, Middle East and Africa</strong> <ul><li>Mapping Anywhere SARL - France - <a href="http://www.mappinganywhere.com/">http://www.mappinganywhere.com/</a></li></ul><p>more information will be available at this link as the program advances: <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/controlpanel/blogs/&rsquo;">Arc2Earth Resellers</a> </p><p><strong>Arc2Earth Version 2.1</strong> - Last month we released V2.1 of the A2E, it contains lots of new features and bug fixes. You can download the Trial version by <a href="http://www.arc2earth.net/cs">visiting our user forum</a>, creating an account and then going to the Downloads section. The online <a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/support/ChangeLog.txt">change log</a> is available here and you can see a list of reasons why you might want to use Arc2Earth versus ArcGIS 9.3 native KML Exporter. Version 2.1 will have several more patches before Version 2.2 which contains the UI for creating and consuming Arc2Earth Cloud Services </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Arc2Earth Cloud Services</strong> - Wow, so much has changed since we <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2008/07/31/Arc2Earth-Services.aspx">first announced</a> work on the Cloud last July. The intent and vision is the same but both technical hurdles and feature creep have slightly delayed our public beta. That being said, I am incredibly excited about this service and what it will enable our users to accomplish, I can&rsquo;t wait to get it into their hands. </p><p><strong>Update</strong> - Added some <a href="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2009/01/22/Arc2Earth-Cloud-Services-_2D00_-Upload.aspx">quick videos here</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>here&rsquo;s a quick peak: </p><p><em>ArcMap Integration</em> &ndash; create and edit your maps directly from ArcMap using some new A2E toolbars and windows. You can add &ldquo;cloud layers&rdquo; directly to your local map and then use the native editing tools in ArcMap to make changes. Every resource in your cloud instance is controlled by login and ACL lists so you can create groups users who all work remotely on the live data. There are also bulk upload/download tools so you can get a fresh copy of any layer anytime you need to perform heavy lifting GIS analysis. </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/A2E_CloudExplorer_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/A2E_CloudExplorer.png">Larger Image</a></p><p><em></em></p><p><em>KML</em> &ndash; The KML engine used in the service can be applied to any resource that serves features. There are a couple of endpoints where KML can be returned but in the samples below, it is the&nbsp;&quot;search&quot; resource.&nbsp;All aspects of the KML (labeling, balloon templates, styling, height, filtering etc)&nbsp;are applied at runtime and streamed out. In general, Arc2Earth will always be able to create and serve static files but the focus in the Cloud is the dynamic creation of KML. What&rsquo;s even better is that any of these endpoints support REST parameters that allow you to control this from the client. For instance, here are four different representations of the same proximity search: </p><p>HTML View </p><p>&nbsp;<img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_html_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_html.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>KML View &ndash; just labels applied </p><p>.../Demographics/StarbucksWorld/MapServer/0/search?q=near(Midtown,+NYC,+1mi)&amp;limit=20&amp;f=kml&amp;p={&quot;label&quot;:&quot;[!address]&quot;} </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_label_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_label.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>KML View &ndash; Simple Renderer, 3D Marker Symbols </p><p>.../Demographics/StarbucksWorld/MapServer/0/search?q=near(Midtown,+NYC,+1mi)&amp;limit=20&amp;f=km &amp;p={&quot;rend&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple&quot;,&quot;symbol&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:{&quot;html&quot;:&quot;FF00FF&quot;},&quot;scale&quot;:15}}} </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_model_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_model.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>KML View &ndash; Class Breaks Renderer on distance, 3D Marker Symbols </p><p>.../Demographics/StarbucksWorld/MapServer/0/search?q=near(Midtown,+NYC,+1mi)&amp;limit=30&amp;f=kml &amp;p={&quot;rend&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;ClassBreaks&quot;,&quot;field&quot;:&quot;distance&quot;,&quot;breaks&quot;:[150,500,1500],&quot;symbols&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;FF00FF&quot;,&quot;scale&quot;:25},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;FFFF00&quot;,&quot;scale&quot;:15},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Simple3DMarkerSymbol&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cylinder&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;0000FF&quot;,&quot;scale&quot;:5}]}} </p><p><img height="247" src="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_cb_tn.png" style="width: 350px; height: 247px" width="350" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arc2earth.com/screenshots/ProxSearch_kml_cb.png">Larger Image</a></p><p>While it is very useful for one off links or scripting, sending json via the query string can be an issue so any of these can also be accessed by url as well.

I for one am looking forward to what is built using these services in the future</p><p><br />I&rsquo;ll be helping to man the Arc2Earth booth at the UC next week so if you&rsquo;re in around, please feel free to stop by and say hi. <br /></p><p>(please visit Arc2Earth at the 2008 ESRI User Conference in San Diego next week&nbsp;&ndash; Booth 2217)</p><img src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/aggbug.aspx?PostID=15608" width="1" height="1">";}i:5;a:10:{s:5:"title";s:39:"GETools - Custom Tools for Google Earth";s:4:"link";s:84:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2008/04/16/GETools.aspx";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Wed, 16 Apr 2008 18:07:00 GMT";s:4:"guid";s:42:"53332bb2-7758-437e-86ab-e8e36e8e971d:14236";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:5:"admin";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"6";}s:8:"comments";s:72:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/comments/14236.aspx";s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:81:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/commentrss.aspx?PostID=14236";}s:11:"description";s:1871:"<p>Now that Google Earth 4.3 is officially out the door, I wanted to share another product that we&rsquo;ve been working on.

What is new in this beta release is the ability to directly embed the API from Microsoft and Google into ArcMap. You can drape your own data over the existing globes and then use this as an element on your Page Layout for exporting to either paper or digital copies. The process of draping your current map over the globes happens automatically and on a background thread, so its really intuitive to work with and doesn&rsquo;t stall the main thread ArcMap uses for most of its own work [2].

You can access these views from ArcMap&rsquo;s View menu or more commonly, from the small buttons that appear below the main map.

The first synchronizes the view with your current map view and the second opens the Option page for the current view. </p><p><img height="61" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/customviewbar.png" style="width: 182px; height: 61px" width="182" /></p><p>Overlay Data<br />There are a couple methods to overlay data on the embedded globes. The first is the automatic overlay of the active map data using background generated tiles.

You can drop any number of VE view elements on the layout and then resize/reposition them as needed. As frame elements, you can also use ArcMap&rsquo;s build-in features to display custom frames, backgrounds or shadows.

We hope we&rsquo;ve accomplished our goals of fixing/adding to existing functionality while also including lots of new features as well. For this post, I&rsquo;m going to stick to some of the new features we added in relation to Google Earth/KML and how they can be used together to automate the process of publishing your larger sets of data to Google Earth. For a discussion on how this relates to Google&#39;s new Enterprise tools, <a href="http://www.ogleearth.com/2007/07/google_earth_en_3.html">you can look here</a>.</p><p>Vector Regions<br />KML Regions were added to Google Earth some time ago but remain one of the most underused features in the entire KML spec. The Region design&nbsp;is extremely flexible and as such, leave most of the complex settings to the KML creator instead of providing an existing framework that we can all hang our data on. This makes sense from a Google perspective but it also leaves many in the community scratching their heads when decided how to use Regions to help with their data exports. The main goal of Regions from a GIS data perspective is to allow your layers to act like the base data in GE. That is, allow it to stream down in chunks and to make it visible based on the altitude of viewer (scale based rendering). A2E automates this process for each of your layers.</p><p>KML purists will immediately see an issue with the output of our vector regions: all data is clipped to the region extent. In a perfect world, GE would support Placemarks belonging to multiple regions but at this time (and in the beta KML 2.2 spec), it only allows for a single region per placemark. With point data, this is a non issue but with polyline and polygon data the issue is quite important, especially with layers containing variable polygon sizes that may span multiple regions (think of a polyline that represents a long river, it will almost certainly span regions). There is no good choice for which region will contain a placemark and by arbitrarily picking a region, you end up with placemarks turning on/off when they shouldn&rsquo;t (or worse, never displaying at all until you hit the one region that contains the data). You could export the data so that each feature belongs to the region that fully contains it&rsquo;s extent but this just causes larger features to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; into view well before the rest of the features in the layer (and well before you even wanted them to display). What you end up with is a patchwork instead of the traditional scale based approach common in GIS packages. We felt this was not what the user expected when compared to their desktop software and coincidently, with how the base vector data in GE works.</p><p>As a compromise, we decided the best way to ensure universal zoom activation was to clip the features instead of deciding what region they would reside in. Unfortunately, once this happens, the data is really only good for visualization purposes since its relative topology has been utterly destroyed. What you&nbsp;get for this tradeoff is the clean, scale dependent streaming of your vector data into GE. In practice, I think this is acceptable since one of the main goals of GE has always been the fast visualization of data. Analysis can be left to alternate feeds or backend server processing.</p><p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/arc2earth1533176949/Census_109Congress/Census_109Congress_nl.kmz">Here&rsquo;s a sample for US Census data</a>, zoom in until you see the data appear. When you pan or zoom to another location, you will see the data streamed into GE in&nbsp;predictable region chunks. Since these are vector placemarks and not raster groundoverlays, you can display labels and info balloons as well.</p><p><img height="253" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE_Census_Vector%20copy.png" style="width:350px;height:253px;" width="350" /></p><p>Next, our implementation of regions has always been a little different than others, by using a uniform grid we can update portions of the whole at any time (say, a parcel subdivision in a state wide layer). A2E uses &quot;Universal Regions&quot; (akin to the tile structure in Google Maps) so we can schedule &quot;updates&quot; to vector tiles just like in the GM/VE tile exporter. A universal grid gives you concrete names for all regions and files and allows you to update only portions of the extent. The A2E Enterprise Masks then allow you to schedule updates for inclusion/exclusion in the masks and then only these areas would be exported. </p><p>Here&#39;s are some other examples showing <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/arc2earth1533176949/SLOSH_GE/SLOSH_GE_nl.kmz">Hurricane data for the NYC area</a> and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/arc2earth1533176949/Census_Pop/Census_Pop_nl.kmz">Census Blocks for Florida</a></p><p><img height="253" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE_SLOSH_Vector%20copy.png" style="width:350px;height:253px;" width="350" />&nbsp;</p><p><img height="253" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE_Census_Block_Vector%20copy.png" style="width:350px;height:253px;" width="350" /></p><p>It should also be noted that we added many new options and optimizations for creating raster regions (or superoverlays) in V2 as well. Mixed image format, variable image size depending on level, optimized LOD settings and several other enhancements should really help in speeding up your raster regions in GE.</p><p><br />Scheduler<br />The A2E Scheduler was introduced in a previous version to export Google Maps or MS Virtual Earth tiles and publish them automatically on a time schedule. In V2, this same functionality is available when exporting KML documents as well, including KML documents that have layers with regions. This may seem as a small change but in practice, this provides the vital &ldquo;automation&rdquo; portion of the framework mentioned above. Unlike using something Windows Scheduled Tasks, the A2E Scheduler runs pre and post operations on export jobs. For instance, prior to a job start the current time can be used to calculate HTTP expires headers for anything published to Amazon S3. Likewise, scripts can be run to either prepare data before or to perhaps copy data to another server when the export is done.</p><p><br />KML Shared Documents<br />This is a relatively simple addition to A2E that will provide a lot of functionality for users exporting large KML documents that need to be updated frequently. A shared KML document is essentially a KML file A2E manages that contains NetworkLinks to any other documents you have created. For instance, you could export&nbsp; Zoning, Block and Parcels layers to separate KML files (or more then likely, separate Region aware caches) and then reference them all from the top level, shared document. Nothing revolutionary here, this is done all the time by many KML users but this functionality will both automate the process and provide publishing for the document as well (Amazon S3 or local server). You can add or remove from the documents using a simple interface and the Scheduler also has post processing to add/remove from them as well (e.g. a time series exported daily would add links to the shared document automatically). The obvious benefit is the ability to update only portions of your shared KML document&rsquo;s content when only small changes occur. This is very different from the all or nothing approach used the A2E V1 KML Exporter.</p><p>Putting it All Together<br />Given the three features described above, you can setup a system that fully automates exporting, publishing and maintaining very large amounts of vector and raster data in KML format. Use A2E to set export options for each of your layers and save the option file. Optionally assign Inclusion/Exclusion masks to tell A2E what areas of your data to update. Use Scheduler to program the frequency of the updates. Finally, use a top level, shared KML document as the link to give all of your users. The Network Links contained in the shared document will ensure they always have the latest data. <a href="http://www.ogleearth.com/2007/07/kmls_region_ama.html">As has been mentioned in other places</a>, batch export to read only caches can be far more efficient then serving data dynamically from server software. How often does your data actually change? Can it wait up to a minute, an hour, a day? Many corporate reporting systems rely heavily on batch processed databases for analysis and visualization. Perhaps this is something that can be applied to geospatial data as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AtomPub + KML<br />While this will not be a part of V2, it does represent where syndicated geospatial could go in the future and in this regard, is something that I&rsquo;d like Arc2Earth to work directly with.&nbsp;It has been argued that the newly released Atom Publishing Protocol (APP) is a perfect conduit for exposing KML data (or any other data) to a variety of clients in addition to providing a universal, RESTful method for updates. I won&rsquo;t go into the details, mainly because <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/528/atompub-kml-and-google-earth/">there are others that have a much better grasp on the subject</a> but also because the discussion seems a little fluid as well. Here are some great links to get you started:</p><p>Gregor Rothfuss of Google posts some follow up and discussion topics <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/geo-web-rest/browse_thread/thread/cd67f24b6ab5a48a">here</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/geo-web-rest/web/kml-gdata-ideas">here</a>. In short, make Google Earth a limited APP client and Google My Maps an APP server (read, write). The latter would use GData as the store and presumably provide server functionality to process feed updates from APP clients and some limited search based on OpenSearch. In this regard, I could see Arc2Earth enabling ArcMap as a full APP client for the MyMaps APP server. Many issues to work out but a GIS client with good editing tools and bulk loading capabilities combined with a flexible, easy to use client like MyMaps seems very attractive. Multiple editors could then work on the data from both ArcMap clients and MyMaps browser clients and the entire feed would still be available to any other client to view (GE, VE, OpenLayers etc). </p><p>I really like the AtomPub + geospatial conenction, I&rsquo;m still waiting for some additional &ldquo;a-ha&rdquo; moments to clarify my thoughts but I have to give credit to those who have already put this all together. In particular, <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/">Sean Gilles</a> who has been hammering out the RESTful geoweb for quite some time now.</p><p>Listening To: Gorillaz - Dare - Demon Days</p><img src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/aggbug.aspx?PostID=9733" width="1" height="1">";s:7:"summary";s:10948:"<p><a href="http://www.arc2earth.com">Arc2Earth</a> V2 is slated for release in about a month.

The A2E Enterprise Masks then allow you to schedule updates for inclusion/exclusion in the masks and then only these areas would be exported. </p><p>Here&#39;s are some other examples showing <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/arc2earth1533176949/SLOSH_GE/SLOSH_GE_nl.kmz">Hurricane data for the NYC area</a> and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/arc2earth1533176949/Census_Pop/Census_Pop_nl.kmz">Census Blocks for Florida</a></p><p><img height="253" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE_SLOSH_Vector%20copy.png" style="width:350px;height:253px;" width="350" />&nbsp;</p><p><img height="253" src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/sdl/public/images/GE_Census_Block_Vector%20copy.png" style="width:350px;height:253px;" width="350" /></p><p>It should also be noted that we added many new options and optimizations for creating raster regions (or superoverlays) in V2 as well. Mixed image format, variable image size depending on level, optimized LOD settings and several other enhancements should really help in speeding up your raster regions in GE.</p><p><br />Scheduler<br />The A2E Scheduler was introduced in a previous version to export Google Maps or MS Virtual Earth tiles and publish them automatically on a time schedule. In V2, this same functionality is available when exporting KML documents as well, including KML documents that have layers with regions. This may seem as a small change but in practice, this provides the vital &ldquo;automation&rdquo; portion of the framework mentioned above. Unlike using something Windows Scheduled Tasks, the A2E Scheduler runs pre and post operations on export jobs. For instance, prior to a job start the current time can be used to calculate HTTP expires headers for anything published to Amazon S3. Likewise, scripts can be run to either prepare data before or to perhaps copy data to another server when the export is done.</p><p><br />KML Shared Documents<br />This is a relatively simple addition to A2E that will provide a lot of functionality for users exporting large KML documents that need to be updated frequently. A shared KML document is essentially a KML file A2E manages that contains NetworkLinks to any other documents you have created. For instance, you could export&nbsp; Zoning, Block and Parcels layers to separate KML files (or more then likely, separate Region aware caches) and then reference them all from the top level, shared document. Nothing revolutionary here, this is done all the time by many KML users but this functionality will both automate the process and provide publishing for the document as well (Amazon S3 or local server). You can add or remove from the documents using a simple interface and the Scheduler also has post processing to add/remove from them as well (e.g. a time series exported daily would add links to the shared document automatically). The obvious benefit is the ability to update only portions of your shared KML document&rsquo;s content when only small changes occur. This is very different from the all or nothing approach used the A2E V1 KML Exporter.</p><p>Putting it All Together<br />Given the three features described above, you can setup a system that fully automates exporting, publishing and maintaining very large amounts of vector and raster data in KML format. Use A2E to set export options for each of your layers and save the option file. Optionally assign Inclusion/Exclusion masks to tell A2E what areas of your data to update. Use Scheduler to program the frequency of the updates. Finally, use a top level, shared KML document as the link to give all of your users. The Network Links contained in the shared document will ensure they always have the latest data. <a href="http://www.ogleearth.com/2007/07/kmls_region_ama.html">As has been mentioned in other places</a>, batch export to read only caches can be far more efficient then serving data dynamically from server software. How often does your data actually change? Can it wait up to a minute, an hour, a day? Many corporate reporting systems rely heavily on batch processed databases for analysis and visualization. Perhaps this is something that can be applied to geospatial data as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AtomPub + KML<br />While this will not be a part of V2, it does represent where syndicated geospatial could go in the future and in this regard, is something that I&rsquo;d like Arc2Earth to work directly with.&nbsp;It has been argued that the newly released Atom Publishing Protocol (APP) is a perfect conduit for exposing KML data (or any other data) to a variety of clients in addition to providing a universal, RESTful method for updates. I won&rsquo;t go into the details, mainly because <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/528/atompub-kml-and-google-earth/">there are others that have a much better grasp on the subject</a> but also because the discussion seems a little fluid as well. Here are some great links to get you started:</p><p>Gregor Rothfuss of Google posts some follow up and discussion topics <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/geo-web-rest/browse_thread/thread/cd67f24b6ab5a48a">here</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/geo-web-rest/web/kml-gdata-ideas">here</a>. In short, make Google Earth a limited APP client and Google My Maps an APP server (read, write). The latter would use GData as the store and presumably provide server functionality to process feed updates from APP clients and some limited search based on OpenSearch. In this regard, I could see Arc2Earth enabling ArcMap as a full APP client for the MyMaps APP server. Many issues to work out but a GIS client with good editing tools and bulk loading capabilities combined with a flexible, easy to use client like MyMaps seems very attractive. Multiple editors could then work on the data from both ArcMap clients and MyMaps browser clients and the entire feed would still be available to any other client to view (GE, VE, OpenLayers etc). </p><p>I really like the AtomPub + geospatial conenction, I&rsquo;m still waiting for some additional &ldquo;a-ha&rdquo; moments to clarify my thoughts but I have to give credit to those who have already put this all together. In particular, <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/">Sean Gilles</a> who has been hammering out the RESTful geoweb for quite some time now.</p><p>Listening To: Gorillaz - Dare - Demon Days</p><img src="http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/aggbug.aspx?PostID=9733" width="1" height="1">";}i:10;a:10:{s:5:"title";s:28:"Google Maps Draggable Routes";s:4:"link";s:105:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2007/06/28/Google-Maps-Draggable-Routes.aspx";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Thu, 28 Jun 2007 19:08:00 GMT";s:4:"guid";s:41:"53332bb2-7758-437e-86ab-e8e36e8e971d:8837";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:5:"admin";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"2";}s:8:"comments";s:71:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/comments/8837.aspx";s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:80:"http://www.spatialdatalogic.com/CS/blogs/brian_flood/commentrss.aspx?PostID=8837";}s:11:"description";s:743:"<p>this is simply amazing that I have to post about it...First, goto <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> and get some directions.
