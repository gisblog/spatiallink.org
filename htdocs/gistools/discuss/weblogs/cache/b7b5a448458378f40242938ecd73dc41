(AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGANMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)</p></div> <p>The White House on Friday released what it called a discussion draft of a bill aimed at giving consumers more control over how data about them is collected. But privacy advocates, including Democratic members of Congress, raised concerns that the legislation might actually make things worse.</p> <p>Even the Federal Trade Commission, the agency at the heart of the proposal, appears to have reservations.</p> <p>“We are pleased that the Administration has made consumer privacy a priority, and this legislative proposal provides a good starting point for further discussion," an agency spokesperson said in a statement. "However, we have concerns that the draft bill does not provide consumers with the strong and enforceable protections needed to safeguard their privacy. We look forward to working with Congress and the Administration to strengthen the proposal.”</p> <p>The White House declined to comment on the growing criticism. The president announced the legislation during a speech at the Federal Trade Commission in January, saying it would be released within 45 days, but the core of the legislation dates back to a set of principles outlined by the administration <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf">in 2012.</a></p> <p>"In this digital age, particularly as big data innovations drive advances across our economy, more and more data about Americans is being collected and stored," a fact sheet announcing the draft legislation said. "And, even though responsible companies provide us with tools to control privacy settings and decide how our personal information is used, too many Americans still feel they have lost control over their data."</p> <p>The draft bill would allow industries to develop their own codes of conduct or privacy policies that would then be enforced by the FTC. "Based on that model, all current practices related to data collection, use, and sharing – even flawed practices – would be allowed to continue," Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said in a joint statement, and the FTC's authority to prevent unfair acts or practices would be curtailed.</p> <p>"Unfortunately, not only does this bill fail to move consumer protection forward, it may move it backward," their statement said.</p> <p>Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, also criticized the draft bill. "It fails to give the FTC, the country’s key privacy regulator, 'rule-making' authority to craft reasonable safeguards, and actually empowers the companies that now harvest our mobile, social, location, financial, and health data, leaving them little to fear from regulators," he said in a statement.</p> <p>Privacy advocates also worry that the plan might strain the resources of the agency. "There's a logistical problem with the FTC and the public having to review hundreds of these codes," Laura Moy, senior counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute, said in an interview.</p> <p>Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge, agreed. "It's not clear to me that this is a very practical approach," he said.</p> <p>The draft would also preempt state laws, some of which are stronger than those laid out in the proposal, and would exempt start-ups from privacy requirements for the first 18 months of data collection, privacy advocates said.</p> <p>Not everyone criticized the White House's effort. Several technology industry-related groups released statements praising the draft bill.</p> <p>"Key concepts in the bill that will advance the privacy discussion in a very practical way include the focus on context to shape appropriate uses of data, the recognition that assessing benefit and risk is important, and the introduction of Privacy Review Boards as internal or external structures that can help approve beneficial uses of data that could otherwise be constrained by law," said Jules Polonetsky, the executive director of the Future of Privacy Forum, which is <a href="http://www.futureofprivacy.org/about/supporters/">backed</a> by companies tied to technology and data-mining industries.</p> <p>There was a behind-the-scenes scramble to change parts of the bill this week, according to multiple the privacy advocates who took part in the back and forth, which changed at least one significant aspect of the bill involving privacy standards for communications companies.</p> <p>“We were pleased to see that the Administration took our suggestion and removed the provision, found in an earlier draft, which would have moved telecommunications carriers and cable companies from the privacy regime regulated and enforced by the FCC to a self-regulatory system within the FTC's purview," Pallone and Schakowsky's statement said. Such a provision would have weakened privacy rules now set to be enforced under Thursday's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/27/the-fccs-net-neutrality-decision-could-mean-stronger-privacy-rules-for-internet-service-providers/"> net neutrality decision </a> by the Federal Communications Commission. The ruling reclassified Internet service providers as "common carriers" like telephone companies.</p> <p>Moy blamed the last-minute scramble on many members of the privacy community being left out of the development of the bill until very late in the process. "They engaged with us too late," she said. "I still don't understand why they waited until a week before this self-imposed deadline to reach out to privacy advocates."</p> <p>While some organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, were looped into the process earlier, many other privacy groups told the Post they were unable to review a version of the draft until a meeting at the Department of Commerce last Friday.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Politico reported that some technology trade groups were also upset about their access to the process through which the draft was developed.</p> <p>In its fact sheet, the White House said the draft was "offered in the spirit of bringing all stakeholders into a public dialogue to advance new privacy protections."</p> <p>Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), another critic of the draft, said he would soon introduce his own version of legislation aimed providing accountability and transparency for the data mining industry.</p> <p>"Next week, I will introduce legislation that will allow consumers to access and correct their information to help ensure maximum accuracy," Markey said in a press release. "The bill also provides consumers with the right to stop data brokers from using, sharing, or selling their personal information for marketing purposes."</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43e146f0/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166638365/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e146f0/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"0";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:151:"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/27/the-white-houses-draft-of-a-consumer-privacy-bill-is-out-and-even-the-ftc-is-worried/feed/";}s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:15:"Andrea Peterson";}s:7:"summary";s:1574:"The White House on Friday released what it called a discussion draft of a bill aimed at giving consumers more control over how data about them is collected.

The landmark vote was aimed at ensuring "net neutrality" -- the principle that all online traffic be treated the same. While the actual regulations have yet to be released, the reclassification could also bring more privacy protections to Internet users -- assuming the change survives the<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/12/whos-going-to-sue-the-fcc-over-net-neutrality-probably-the-cable-lobby/"> legal challenges that are sure to follow.</a></p> <p>Right now, enforcing privacy restrictions on Internet service providers is up to the Federal Trade Commission -- the government's de facto privacy watchdog. But as so-called common carriers, Internet providers now fall under the jurisdiction of the FCC.</p> <p>The FTC declined to comment. But Republican FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen said as much during an interview on "<a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?321665-1/communicators-maureen-ohlhausen">The Communicators</a>" last year: "If an entity is a common carrier providing common carrier services, we can't bring actions against them," she said. "If broadband service is reclassified as a common carrier service under Title II, I think that would seriously call into question the ability of the FTC to bring those kinds of actions."</p> <p>FCC spokesperson Mark Wigfield confirmed that the agency's vote will give it more oversight over the privacy practices of Internet service providers. Privacy advocates say this is probably a win for consumers, because for the first time ISPs will have to abide by a specific set of rules designed to protect the privacy of communications.</p> <p>The Communications Act, which governs the FCC, includes "one of the strongest federal privacy laws currently on the books," according to Laura Moy, senior counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute. "One reason is because the scope of information that is covered is broad," she said, including pretty much all of the information collected by a carrier in order to deliver communications services to their consumers. The law also requires customers be notified if their data will be used for marketing and other purposes, Moy said, although the FCC will ultimately decide what that looks like for Internet providers.</p> <p>Wigfield said the FCC will not apply existing rules designed for telephone service directly to Internet service providers, but that it will apply a key part of Title II that confers privacy powers, Section 222. It will take further actions to define how those protections apply to broadband if necessary, he said.</p> <p>Structurally, the FCC's approach to enforcement might also benefit consumers, privacy advocates said.</p> <p>The Trade Commission's enforcement is primarily reactive; while they also issue guidance to tell people what actions are likely to trigger enforcement, they often have to wait for someone to do something the agency considers unfair or deceptive. And for privacy, that often means holding companies to the broadly defined privacy policies they advertise.</p> <p>But the FCC is different. "The FCC has broad rule-making authority," said Moy. "They can set standards that companies will have to abide by before the troubling practices have even taken place."</p> <p>And privacy advocates say the agency is pretty aggressive at enforcing their current privacy rules on telephone providers. "The FCC's privacy regulations have worked very well, which is why so many people are unaware of them  -- because they are so rigid about enforcing them, people don't even have to think about it," said Feld. "It's an area they've always taken things very seriously."</p> <p>And that could rein in some controversial online tracking practices, like "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/verizon-atandt-tracking-their-users-with-super-cookies/2014/11/03/7bbbf382-6395-11e4-bb14-4cfea1e742d5_story.html">supercookies</a>," unique identifiers that some mobile broadband providers have been inserting into their customers' traffic, according to Feld, or at least require more robust consent mechanisms.</p> <p>"A lot of the practices we see on the broadband side are unthinkable on the telephone side because no one would even think of trying them," he said.</p> <p>The FTC won't be entirely out of regulating online privacy: It will still be the watchdog for the troublesome privacy practices of many services and Web sites, a huge chunk of the equation. "The FTC can go after telemarketers even though they use phone lines as their medium for communications," Moy explained. The same principle will apply to the Internet: The FCC will oversee the pipes, while the FTC will be able to wield their enforcement tools against those who operate services that use the pipes.</p> <p>Going after those services, rather than carriers themselves, has been the bulk of the FTC's online enforcement actions, anyhow. But the agency has significant expertise in broadly thinking about consumer privacy -- and it appears to be interested in working with the FCC when it comes to enforcing privacy on common carriers down the line: The agency has <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_statements/prepared-statement-federal-trade-commission-prepaid-calling-cards/p074406prepaidcc_0.pdf">for years</a> supported rolling back the exemption that blocks it from taking action against common carriers, which would allow it join the FCC in enforcing privacy protections against that group of companies.<strong> </strong></p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43e009d6/sc/46/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166646166/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43e009d6/sc/46/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"0";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:164:"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/27/the-fccs-net-neutrality-decision-could-mean-stronger-privacy-rules-for-internet-service-providers/feed/";}s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:15:"Andrea Peterson";}s:7:"summary";s:1623:"The Federal Communications Commission made history on Thursday, classifying Internet providers as public utilities for the first time.

But on Friday, fans of the actor got the terrible news: the man who played Spock on the Star Trek franchise juggernaut died at his home in Los Angeles at 83.</p> <p>Perhaps no actor was tied to Star Trek more than Leonard Nimoy, whose character Spock helped turn the franchise into a cultural touchstone. Though many alums of the show have had second and third public careers since — William Shatner on Boston Legal, George Takei as a gay-rights activist, Wil Wheaton and Patrick Stewart as lovable Internet celebrities — Nimoy is so synonymous with his half-Vulcan alter ego that fans revolted upon seeing the title of his first memoir, "I Am Not Spock," despite Nimoy's insistence that behind the name was merely a nuanced explanation of the distinctions between himself and his character.</p> <p>Nimoy passed away today from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The scantily clad models in the book were Nimoy's effort to capture that mystical idea and put it on paper, but like his autobiography, it stirred up more controversy than he anticipated. Nevertheless, Nimoy has repeatedly drawn inspiration from Judaism.

The <em>kohanim </em>are merely the channels, not the source, of the blessing, which comes from God. Unfortunately, all sorts of silly superstitions have arisen about this ritual, such as 'Don't look at the <em>kohanim</em>, or you'll go blind!' and other nonsense ... Like most Jewish children, young Leonard could not contain his curiosity about what the <em>kohanim</em> were really doing up there in front of the congregation.</p></blockquote> <p>Years later, when Nimoy was trying to think of ways to flesh out his character's cultural background — he was filming the episode that first introduced viewers to Spock's home planet — the hand gesture came to him.

We learn that Spock's Vulcan father is upset about Spock's decision to join Starfleet, which is led from Earth, by Earthlings. A crisis later requires Spock to give his father a blood transfusion, and in another indication of his otherness, we see that Vulcan blood is green.</p> <p>Other characters on the show helped promote Star Trek's racially progressive message; you had Uhura, who shared with Captain Kirk the first televised interracial kiss; a Russian tactical officer in the midst of the real-world Cold War; and a Japanese pilot. But Nimoy had the unenviable challenge of making social commentary with a character whose disposition was perpetually deadpan — not an easy task. It helped some that Kirk and Spock were foils to one another.</p> <p><em>[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/02/27/leonard-nimoys-final-public-words-live-long-and-prosper/">Leonard Nimoy's final public words: 'Live long and prosper'</a>]</em></p> <p>And in part because they're such different characters, a great deal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk/Spock">fan fiction</a> has come about exploring their possible romantic connection. Whether you believe the eroticism is truly there, Spock helped people talk about sexuality both academically and otherwise in new ways.</p> <p>Being in character for 14 hours a day caused Spock and Nimoy to merge. Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that Nimoy was becoming Spock, that the Vulcan was taking over. "My personality changed," he told the BBC in 2009. "I became more rational. I became more logical. I became more thoughtful. I became less emotional. ... I could feel it on the weekends."</p> <p>That's not the only effect Nimoy experienced. His character's buttoned up nature, combined with his growing fame, drove the actor to alcohol.</p> <p>In a 2001 interview with his co-star William Shatner, Nimoy admitted that his assistant would <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1361090/Star-Trek-drove-me-to-drink-says-Spock.html">hand him paper cups</a> of wine and liquor on set after shooting wound down for the day. Nimoy's addiction has been construed as a kind of Star Trek escapism — an impression that didn't go away after the series ended. The performer's résumé includes a dizzying array of television appearances, documentary voiceovers and musical recordings like this famous one from 1967:</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AGF5ROpjRAU" width="606" height="455" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>But Nimoy maintains that that impression is a myth, spread partly by the negative reception to "I Am Not Spock." Twenty years after that book, Nimoy released "I Am Spock," a second autobiography meant to fix some of the problems surrounding the first. Some reviewers <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,298931,00.html">remained unconvinced</a> by Nimoy's more vocal defense of his character.</p> <p>"In many ways he has yet to come to grips with his famous alter ego," wrote Entertainment Weekly. "'The Vulcan was always with me,' he writes plaintively about his post-Trek acting experiences."</p> <p>Whatever conflict he may have felt over his character, Nimoy seemed to have made his peace with it. He reprised his role in the two most recent Star Trek films despite vowing to cut himself off years before. He also lent his voice — or was it Spock's? — in 2010 to a popular online multiplayer game, Star Trek Online. He appeared to delight in being called "Spock Prime" to Zachary Quinto's new Spock, in the alternate history envisioned by director J.J. Abrams.</p> <p>"It gives a dignified presentation of the character," he told <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/a-mind-meld-qa-with-leonard-nimoy/?_php=true&#38;_type=blogs&#38;_php=true&#38;_type=blogs&#38;_php=true&#38;_type=blogs&#38;_r=2">the New York Times</a>. Asked jokingly whether "Prime" could also be used in the "USDA sense," Nimoy added: "That's right. This is the good stuff."</p> <p>Passing the torch to Quinto seems to have triggered a new discovery: Spock belongs to somebody else now, if not to all of us.</p> <p>It's a wrenching bit of reality, and it's a little scary. But it's a reality born out of what makes Star Trek so interesting: The people inhabit a persistent universe with its own history and logic. Unlike other franchises — say, Spider Man or James Bond, which exist in a timeless world of their own and get rebooted over and over — characters in Star Trek age. They're mortal. They go through black-hole-time-warp-things and never return home.</p> <p>And while it's sad when their story lines finally come to an end, those stories are so much richer for having explored the full breadth of the human — or Vulcan, or android, or Klingon — experience.</p> <p>Just like their real-world actor counterparts.</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43de4af6/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"0";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:119:"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/27/leonard-nimoy-is-dead-but-spock-will-live-on-forever/feed/";}s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Brian Fung";}s:7:"summary";s:1535:"For decades, Leonard Nimoy lived and prospered.

The performer's résumé includes a dizzying array of television appearances, documentary voiceovers and musical recordings like this famous one from 1967:</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AGF5ROpjRAU" width="606" height="455" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>But Nimoy maintains that that impression is a myth, spread partly by the negative reception to "I Am Not Spock." Twenty years after that book, Nimoy released "I Am Spock," a second autobiography meant to fix some of the problems surrounding the first. Some reviewers <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,298931,00.html">remained unconvinced</a> by Nimoy's more vocal defense of his character.</p> <p>"In many ways he has yet to come to grips with his famous alter ego," wrote Entertainment Weekly. "'The Vulcan was always with me,' he writes plaintively about his post-Trek acting experiences."</p> <p>Whatever conflict he may have felt over his character, Nimoy seemed to have made his peace with it. He reprised his role in the two most recent Star Trek films despite vowing to cut himself off years before. He also lent his voice — or was it Spock's? — in 2010 to a popular online multiplayer game, Star Trek Online. He appeared to delight in being called "Spock Prime" to Zachary Quinto's new Spock, in the alternate history envisioned by director J.J. Abrams.</p> <p>"It gives a dignified presentation of the character," he told <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/a-mind-meld-qa-with-leonard-nimoy/?_php=true&#38;_type=blogs&#38;_php=true&#38;_type=blogs&#38;_php=true&#38;_type=blogs&#38;_r=2">the New York Times</a>. Asked jokingly whether "Prime" could also be used in the "USDA sense," Nimoy added: "That's right. This is the good stuff."</p> <p>Passing the torch to Quinto seems to have triggered a new discovery: Spock belongs to somebody else now, if not to all of us.</p> <p>It's a wrenching bit of reality, and it's a little scary. But it's a reality born out of what makes Star Trek so interesting: The people inhabit a persistent universe with its own history and logic. Unlike other franchises — say, Spider Man or James Bond, which exist in a timeless world of their own and get rebooted over and over — characters in Star Trek age. They're mortal. They go through black-hole-time-warp-things and never return home.</p> <p>And while it's sad when their story lines finally come to an end, those stories are so much richer for having explored the full breadth of the human — or Vulcan, or android, or Klingon — experience.</p> <p>Just like their real-world actor counterparts.</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43de4af6/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166640698/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43de4af6/sc/38/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}i:5;a:13:{s:5:"title";s:79:"The Switchboard: The FCC approved its net neutrality rules.

He said he stripped out some of the obligations that apply to phones — there are no caps on how much broadband companies may charge consumers or tariffs on Internet traffic.</p> <p>And after more than a decade of debate at the FCC over net neutrality, Wheeler seemed to recognize the historic importance of the vote, saying “it was the proudest day of my public policy life.”</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"0";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:117:"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/26/the-fcc-set-to-approve-strong-net-neutrality-rules/feed/";}s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:27:"Cecilia Kang and Brian Fung";}s:7:"summary";s:1577:"The Federal Communications Commission for the first time classified Internet providers as public utilities Thursday, a landmark vote that officials said will prevent cable and telecommunications companies from controlling what people see on the Web.

Outreach to Democrats and Internet companies has already begun; on Tuesday, House and Senate Republicans sent invitations to Internet companies for an upcoming meeting on Capitol Hill. Key liberals applauded the FCC vote but also signaled that they intended to work with Republicans on a bill.</p> <p>“Overzealous government bureaucrats should keep their hands off the Internet,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement. “More mandates and regulations on American innovation and entrepreneurship are not the answer, and that’s why Republicans will continue our efforts to stop this misguided scheme.”</p> <p>House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said GOP lawmakers will work on a less aggressive law for net neutrality that doesn’t allow for broadband to be classified as a utility service.</p> <p>“I stand ready to lead the opposition against the FCC’s decision and to work with my colleagues to produce a legislative outcome that truly preserves and protects a free and open Internet,” Scalise said in a statement.</p> <p>Wheeler argued that the rules aren’t draconian. He said he stripped out some of the obligations that apply to phones — there are no caps on how much broadband companies may charge consumers or tariffs on Internet traffic.</p> <p>And after more than a decade of debate at the FCC over net neutrality, Wheeler seemed to recognize the historic importance of the vote, saying “it was the proudest day of my public policy life.”</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166592102/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d20e1c/sc/2/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}i:9;a:13:{s:5:"title";s:48:"Twitter rolls out a few more anti-abuse measures";s:4:"link";s:206:"http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43d67a37/sc/5/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cthe0Eswitch0Cwp0C20A150C0A20C260Ctwitter0Erolls0Eout0Ea0Efew0Emore0Eanti0Eabuse0Emeasures0C/story01.htm";s:11:"description";s:1535:"Twitter took a few more small steps in its ongoing fight to curb harassment on the site Thursday, announcing in a company blog post that it is expanding the ways it can crack down on people who use the platform to harass others.

The watches Apple had on display in October were early prototypes, showing off a few features such as the ability to receive calls, send and receive messages and track fitness stats when the watch is paired with a phone.</p> <p>The Apple Watch will start at $349 and will come in three main varieties -- a sport watch, a mid-tier watch and a luxury gold watch.

But the market is still fairly wide open.

But in roughly 20 states, those efforts have been stymied by state laws.</p> <p>Now, the nation's top telecom regulators want to change that. On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commissions voted 3-2 to override laws preventing Chattanooga, Tenn., and Wilson, N.C. from expanding the high-speed Internet service the cities already offer to some residents.</p> <p>The vote could embolden other cities that feel they have been underserved by traditional Internet providers, potentially undermining years of lobbying by the telecommunications industry.</p> <p>“It's good to see the FCC standing up to phone and cable company efforts to legislate away competition and choice,” Free Press, a consumer advocacy group. “By targeting these protectionist state laws, the FCC is siding with dozens of communities seeking to provide essential broadband services where people have few to no other options.</p> <p>Last year, Chattanooga and Wilson asked the FCC to intervene on their behalf, citing numerous state restrictions on the expansion of broadband service.</p> <p>Chattanooga, for example, cannot build its broadband networks anywhere it does not already provide electricity. "What we're looking at here in Tennessee are people who are literally a tenth of a mile off of our system who have no Internet access," said Harold DePriest, the chief executive of Chattanooga's city-owned power utility, EPB.</p> <p>The FCC's intervention in Wilson, N.C. is even more dramatic, overturning a range of state laws that the city says artificially limits competition.</p> <p>One provision in North Carolina law bars cities from charging prices that are lower than the private incumbents'. Another requires municipalities to gain public support for a city-run service through a special referendum before borrowing money to fund such efforts. A third effectively prohibits cities from building in "unserved areas," according to Wilson's petition.</p> <p>Taken together, these restrictions make it difficult for new providers to compete with established Internet providers, FCC officials have said.</p> <p>“The bottom line of these matters is that some states have created thickets of red tape designed to limit competition,” said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler.  “When local leaders have their hands tied by bureaucratic state red tape, local businesses and residents are the ones who suffer the consequences."</p> <p>Cities advocating for more leeway to offer Internet service say they are trying to address a lingering problem: Consumers don't have enough choices.</p> <p>More than half of Americans have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/04/fcc-chairman-a-duopoly-dominates-basic-internet-service-in-america/">only one choice of Internet provider</a> at speeds of 25 megabits per second — the basic threshold for high-speed Internet under a new definition approved by the FCC last month.</p> <p>Internet providers are expected to challenge the FCC's ruling in court, arguing that the agency lacks the authority to come between a state and the cities under its jurisdiction. Republican lawmakers have warned that FCC intervention on municipal broadband would be an example of government overreach. And other critics argue that the private sector, not taxpayers, should be leading the way in promoting greater Internet access.</p> <p>“In taking this step, the FCC usurps fundamental aspects of state sovereignty. And it disrupts the balance of power between the federal government and state governments that lies at the core of our constitutional system of government,” Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said.</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43d396e4/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"0";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:122:"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/26/the-fcc-rules-against-state-limits-on-city-run-internet/feed/";}s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Brian Fung";}s:7:"summary";s:1595:"For years, cities around the country have been trying to build their own, local competitors to Verizon, Charter and other major Internet providers.

"What we're looking at here in Tennessee are people who are literally a tenth of a mile off of our system who have no Internet access," said Harold DePriest, the chief executive of Chattanooga's city-owned power utility, EPB.</p> <p>The FCC's intervention in Wilson, N.C. is even more dramatic, overturning a range of state laws that the city says artificially limits competition.</p> <p>One provision in North Carolina law bars cities from charging prices that are lower than the private incumbents'. Another requires municipalities to gain public support for a city-run service through a special referendum before borrowing money to fund such efforts. A third effectively prohibits cities from building in "unserved areas," according to Wilson's petition.</p> <p>Taken together, these restrictions make it difficult for new providers to compete with established Internet providers, FCC officials have said.</p> <p>“The bottom line of these matters is that some states have created thickets of red tape designed to limit competition,” said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler.  “When local leaders have their hands tied by bureaucratic state red tape, local businesses and residents are the ones who suffer the consequences."</p> <p>Cities advocating for more leeway to offer Internet service say they are trying to address a lingering problem: Consumers don't have enough choices.</p> <p>More than half of Americans have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/04/fcc-chairman-a-duopoly-dominates-basic-internet-service-in-america/">only one choice of Internet provider</a> at speeds of 25 megabits per second — the basic threshold for high-speed Internet under a new definition approved by the FCC last month.</p> <p>Internet providers are expected to challenge the FCC's ruling in court, arguing that the agency lacks the authority to come between a state and the cities under its jurisdiction. Republican lawmakers have warned that FCC intervention on municipal broadband would be an example of government overreach. And other critics argue that the private sector, not taxpayers, should be leading the way in promoting greater Internet access.</p> <p>“In taking this step, the FCC usurps fundamental aspects of state sovereignty. And it disrupts the balance of power between the federal government and state governments that lies at the core of our constitutional system of government,” Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said.</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43d396e4/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166598749/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d396e4/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}i:13;a:13:{s:5:"title";s:82:"Your guide to net neutrality: Everything you need to know about today’s FCC vote";s:4:"link";s:241:"http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cblogs0Cthe0Eswitch0Cwp0C20A150C0A20C260Cyour0Eguide0Eto0Enet0Eneutrality0Eeverything0Eyou0Eneed0Eto0Eknow0Eabout0Etodays0Efcc0Evote0C/story01.htm";s:11:"description";s:1558:"In just a few hours, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve strict new rules on Internet providers in an attempt to preserve a principle known as "net neutrality."

It would also limit the kinds of services and applications available to users. That's why they're proposing new rules on Internet providers, in an attempt to make sure there's no prioritization of some Web traffic over others.</p> <p><strong>How big a deal is the FCC's vote on net neutrality?</strong></p> <p>It's not an exaggeration to say that this marks a turning point in the history of the Internet. It's the government's most forceful intervention ever into the affairs of Internet providers, who've historically been only lightly regulated. It's the agency's most momentous decision of the 21st century thus far, and almost certainly its biggest determination since 1996, when Congress last updated the nation's telecommunications laws.</p> <p>With the vote, the FCC is recognizing that the Internet is as basic a commodity as telephone service. Internet providers will have to obey standard rules applying to privacy, transparency and nondiscrimination — some of the same rules that govern wired telephony.</p> <p><strong>What will the FCC actually vote on?</strong></p> <p>The rules lay out several key prohibitions on Internet providers. They include: a ban on blocking, meaning that Internet providers won't be able to stop services like Netflix outright; a ban on throttling, or the slowing down of Web traffic; and a ban on paid prioritization, or the speeding up of traffic, particularly in exchange for money.</p> <p>In addition to covering providers of "fixed" broadband service like Comcast or Cox, the draft rules will also apply to wireless carriers, such as Sprint and T-Mobile. This is a big deal for a number of reasons, but the main one is that wireless carriers have never been subjected to full net neutrality regulation. So that means any mobile data you use would be "protected" by these rules.</p> <p><b>What will this mean for <em>my</em> Internet? Will my prices go up? </b></p> <p>This decision has major implications for the future of the Web: Not only does it represent an unprecedented change in the relationship between government and Internet providers, but it also changes how those Internet providers work with businesses on the Internet.</p> <p>Opponents of the FCC's rules warn that strong net neutrality could lead to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/16/the-claim-that-fccs-net-neutrality-decision-would-cost-americans-15-billion-in-new-taxes/">new taxes and fees</a> from state governments. But defenders say that even if the rules give the states wider authority to levy charges on Internet providers, states have always been able to make such decisions on their own.</p> <p>Other opponents worry that the FCC's rules could lead to the direct regulation of retail prices — what Internet providers charge you for service. The FCC insists that its plan forbears, or waives, those parts of the telecommunications law. But Republicans on the commission argue that the agency could still engage in what's called "rate regulation" in a roundabout way: by entertaining petitions from the public that allege unfairness in commercial deals or other business arrangements. Conservatives argue that responding to petitions would amount to a form of after-the-fact regulation.</p> <p>Still, it's important to keep in mind the big picture: Nothing about this vote immediately changes what you pay for Internet or how you experience it. In some ways, that's the whole point.</p> <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p> <p>Everyone in Washington is expecting the Internet providers to sue the FCC to have the rules overturned. Even before mounting their legal challenge, they may seek a court order that would temporarily prevent the rules from taking effect.</p> <p>Who sues, and when, is a really interesting question. Some believe that the biggest Internet providers, such as Comcast, may hold off because they've got things like mergers and other transactions waiting to be approved by the FCC. Suing could hurt their chances of getting those deals green-lighted.</p> <img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.voices.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636658/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/222166597530/u/53/f/636658/c/34656/s/43d38e8e/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/>";}s:5:"slash";a:1:{s:8:"comments";s:1:"0";}s:3:"wfw";a:1:{s:10:"commentrss";s:145:"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/26/your-guide-to-net-neutrality-everything-you-need-to-know-about-todays-fcc-vote/feed/";}s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:10:"Brian Fung";}s:7:"summary";s:1558:"In just a few hours, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve strict new rules on Internet providers in an attempt to preserve a principle known as "net neutrality."
