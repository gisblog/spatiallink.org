<p>The areas of the United States that are most at risk of a potentially invasive salamander fungus are the Pacific coast, the southern Appalachian Mountains and the mid-Atlantic regions, according to a recently published <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/2/150616">U.S. Geological Survey report</a>.</p>
<p>These findings can help managers protect already declining amphibians in the U.S. from the <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, or <em>Bsal</em>, fungus. <em>Bsal</em> is decimating wild salamander populations in Europe and <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=4439#.Vrzsn_lVhBd">could emerge in the U.S.</a> through the captive amphibian trade. The new USGS study identifies areas of the U.S. with high likelihoods of two risks: <em>Bsal</em> introduction and severe consequences for local salamanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eastern U.S. has the highest diversity of salamanders in the world, and the introduction of this new pathogen is likely to be devastating,&rdquo; said Katherine Richgels, a USGS researcher and the lead author of the study. &ldquo;Our findings can help with early <em>Bsal</em> detections by highlighting high-risk areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scientists developed a county-specific <em>Bsal</em> risk assessment for the U.S. by analyzing characteristics of <em>Bsal</em> ecology, such as optimal temperatures for fungal growth, and data on amphibian imports, pet trade establishments and the regional diversity of salamander species. They found that if <em>Bsal</em> enters the country:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total risk of <em>Bsal</em> to salamanders is highest throughout      the eastern U.S., particularly the mid-Atlantic states of New York,      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,      Delaware and Maryland.</li>
<li>The Pacific coast and      Appalachian Mountains are likely to have significant population declines      due to high concentrations of diverse salamander species and mild climates      that are well suited to <em>Bsal</em> growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Amphibians are the most endangered vertebrates in the world,&rdquo; Richgels said. &ldquo;Disease risk assessments like ours can help managers prevent and mitigate losses of vulnerable U.S. salamanders.&rdquo; <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Bsal</em>&nbsp;was first identified in 2013 as the cause of mass wild salamander die-offs in the Netherlands and Belgium. Captive salamander die-offs due to <em>Bsal</em> have occurred in the United Kingdom and Germany. Scientists believe&nbsp;<em>Bsal</em><em>&nbsp;</em>originated in Asia and spread to wild European populations through the import and export of salamanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Bsal</em> represents one of the most significant disease threats to U.S. wildlife since the emergence of white-nose syndrome, which has devastated hibernating bat populations in the eastern U.S.,&rdquo; said Anne Kinsinger, Associate Director of Ecosystems for the USGS.</p>
<p>The USGS risk assessment informed a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service interim rule prohibiting the importation and interstate transport of certain salamander species. The USGS National Wildlife Health Center is leading early detection surveillance for the potential introduction of <em>Bsal</em> in the U.S. Early detection would allow for rapid management actions to prevent and control the spread of the fungus should it be found.</p>
<p>Among the hundreds of invasive species already established in the U.S. is&nbsp;the microscopic <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/ecosystems/disease/chytrid.html">chytrid fungus</a> that has devastated amphibian populations. On February 18, the Department of the Interior released an <a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/National%20EDRR%20Framework.pdf">interdepartmental report</a>.&nbsp;The report proposes to stop the introduction and&nbsp;spread of invasive species&nbsp;through a coordinated set of actions to find and eradicate potential invasive species before they spread and cause harm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the first systematic stream survey of algal toxins in the southeastern United States,&rdquo; said Keith Loftin, the USGS research chemist who led the study. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important, because it provides a better understanding of the occurrence of these microcystins in aquatic ecosystems with flowing waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Microcystins are a well-known public health concern.

<p>Although the maximum microcystin concentration measured in this study (3.2 &micro;g/L) did not exceed World Health Organization moderate risk thresholds (10 &micro;g/L) in the streams sampled, further research is needed to understand the potential effects on water quality and related environmental health concerns in downstream aquatic ecosystems, lakes and drinking water reservoirs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous research indicated that cyanobacteria, a form of algae capable of producing microcystins, were found in 74 percent of the streams assessed throughout the southeastern United States. However, that research did not include the study of microcystins.</p>
<p>This is the first of several regional assessments of algal toxins, which will provide context for the design of future environmental health studies.

<p>&ldquo;Sediment trapping in tidal freshwater wetlands is critical for protecting the water quality of estuaries and enhancing the resilience of those wetlands to sea level rise,&rdquo; said Scott Phillips, USGS science coordinator for the Chesapeake Bay. &ldquo;These wetlands help reduce nutrients and contaminants from reaching the Bay and also provide critical habitat for waterfowl.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A study by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL066830/full">Ensign <em>et al</em></a> demonstrated sediment transport bottlenecks in tidal rivers of Maryland. The bottleneck occurs where watershed sediment is trapped by tidal freshwater swamps at the head-of-tide and where estuarine sediment transported upriver by tidal action is trapped by brackish wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process leaves minimal sediment availability to tidal freshwater wetlands just below the head-of-tide, producing a &ldquo;sediment shadow&rdquo; that reduces the resilience of wetlands to the impacts of sea level rise. The shadow of reduced sediment accumulation also means that Atlantic Coastal Plain watersheds have very little of their watershed sediment delivered to estuaries and the coastal zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research by <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-016-0066-4">Noe <em>et al</em></a> found a difference in the basic chemistry of sediment deposited in tidal freshwater swamps compared to brackish wetlands in South Carolina and Georgia, a determination that further supports the conclusion that watershed sediment is trapped out by tidal freshwater wetlands while estuarine sediment is delivered upstream to brackish wetlands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the Noe study found, sediment accumulation rates have changed over time. Historically, even more sediment was trapped by the upriver tidal freshwater wetlands. The change is likely due to greater availability in the past of &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; sediment from post-colonial land use and soil erosion. Modern sediment trapping is greatest overall in downriver brackish wetlands, likely due to sea level rise that has moved the estuarine turbidity maximum upstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together these studies, along with others, show that tidal freshwater wetlands downstream of the head-of-tide have the lowest sediment accumulation rates along river-to-estuarine gradients. Consequently, these areas may have the least resilience to increased rates of sea level rise. In general, sediment trapping helps tidal wetlands increase in elevation to keep pace with rising sea levels. The effect of excessive saltwater exposure on tidal freshwater swamps is easily seen in places where tree death has produced spindly &ldquo;ghost forests&rdquo; that eventually convert into brackish marshes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sediment shadow also means that little of the watershed sediment and associated nutrient loads in lowland coastal rivers actually reaches estuaries. For example, in the smaller rivers that empty into the Chesapeake Bay (characterized by extensive tidal freshwater wetlands in contrast to minimal tidal freshwater wetlands found in large embayed tributaries), a large portion of the watershed sediment load (and associated phosphorus and nitrogen) is removed by tidal wetlands prior to reaching the bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new insights about the complexity of sediment, carbon, and nutrient transport from watersheds to estuaries can help water quality managers to more accurately forecast the effects of watershed changes on estuarine water quality and improve adaptive management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fog and low clouds have a significant influence on California&rsquo;s coastal ecosystem processes and on the local economy for everything from wine production to tourism.

The fog and low cloud maps can delineate the commonly used term &ldquo;fog belt&rdquo; into zones with increased precision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maps were made using a decade's (1999 - 2009) worth of summertime satellite weather data. Over 26,000 hourly night and day images were classified to identify the presence of fog and low clouds and compiled for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted maps that were as easy to use as the <a href="http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/">USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Maps</a> and as accurate as National Weather Service images so we compiled thousands of satellite images onto one map layer. People can pinpoint what fog zone their house or field is in.

<p>A large active landslide on the western flank of Sumas Mountain in Whatcom County, Washington, is a significant source of sediment to Swift Creek and the salmon-bearing Sumas River, especially after heavy rains. The landslide contains naturally occurring asbestos and elevated levels of metals. Naturally occurring asbestos is described as asbestos found in-place in its natural state, such as in bedrock or soils. Although the landslide has been active since the early 20th century, a 2006 analysis of the sediment revealed a high asbestos content, leading resource managers to treat the sediment with caution.</p>
<p>During a two-year study, USGS scientists measured the amount of sediment carried by the Sumas River during normal and wet years and assessed the settling and transport characteristics of asbestos fibers in river water. Heavier sediment such as sand and gravel settle out quickly, but finer sediment including silt, clay and asbestos fibers settle out more slowly and travel farther downstream.</p>
<p>In water, asbestos fibers can form bundles that are visible when in high concentrations and, when seen up close, give water a miso soup-like appearance that, under most river flows, does not settle out. The study found that the river transported 24,000 and 54,000 tons of suspended sediment in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and observed that samples of river sediment were up to 37 percent asbestos by mass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results from the USGS will help guide agencies managing sediment, and flood and health risks in the Sumas River watershed. &nbsp;</p>

<br><p><strong>WASHINGTON&mdash;</strong>The President&rsquo;s fiscal year (FY) 2017 budget request for the U.S. Geological Survey reflects the USGS's vital role in addressing some of the most pressing challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century by advancing scientific discovery and innovation. The $1.2 billion FY 2017 request supports USGS' ability to maintain the diversity of its scientific expertise so it can continue the large-scale, multi-disciplinary investigations it is uniquely qualified to carry out and provide impartial science to resource managers and planners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a smart, innovative and forward-looking budget that invests in Interior&rsquo;s key missions &ndash; now and in the future &ndash; so we can continue to serve the American people,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. &ldquo;The President&rsquo;s budget provides targeted investments to create economic opportunities by growing our domestic energy portfolio, building climate resilient communities, and revitalizing America&rsquo;s national parks as we mark their 100<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary. Consistent with the President&rsquo;s abiding commitment to Indian Country, this budget provides critical support for Tribal self-determination and economic advancement, including a historic transformation of the Bureau of Indian Education school system to help improve education for Indian children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our diversity of scientific expertise uniquely positions the USGS to help address today's critical natural resource issues,&rdquo; said Suzette Kimball, USGS Director. &ldquo;From earthquakes to invasive species, from water quality to critical minerals, USGS science plays a pivotal role and this budget request supports that important mission."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FY 2017 budget request allows the USGS to advance priorities set forth in the <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2007/1309/">USGS Science Strategy Plans</a>, such as: developing the ground system for Landsat 9; informing the management of water for the 21st century; understanding climate and land-use change; investigating new and emerging invasive species and disease; improving science for rapid disaster response and prevention; developing enhanced mapping tools and products; advancing landscape-level sciences; conducting critical mineral and energy resources research; and pursuing studies that protect environmental health.</p>
<p>This budget is also designed to keep core USGS science programs intact. These programs provide valuable services to the Nation and include science that helps decision makers minimize loss of life and property, manage natural resources, and protect and enhance our quality of life.</p>
<p><em>Key increases in the FY 2017 budget are summarized below.&nbsp;For more detailed information on the President&rsquo;s FY 2017 budget, visit the&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/budget/2017"><em>USGS Budget, Planning, and Integration website</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Water Resources </strong></h3>
<p>The FY 2017 USGS budget request provides an increase of $17.3 million above the FY2016 enacted level for Water Resources research for a total of $228 million. The budget requests $60.2 million for Water Resources programs to use in matching State, municipality, and Tribal contributions for cooperative water efforts. This includes a $4 million increase under the Water Availability and Use Science Program to develop a near real-time assessment of regional and national water-use trends during drought periods. Other increases totaling $8.1 million would integrate water information from multiple agencies, provide state water resource agencies with the necessary base data at the resolution needed for decision making, and would develop better methods for sampling, estimating, aggregating, and presenting water use data. This increase also supports efforts to assess water budgets across snow-dominated regions of the Nation; including assessing systems, anticipating future changes, and extrapolating from monitored to unmonitored locations across critical landscapes in the Arctic.</p>
<p>The USGS budget also includes a $1.4 million increase for the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program to expand the use of flood inundation mapping and rapidly deployable streamgages, which provide crucial data to help manage flood response. In addition, the increase will also target the use of enhanced streamflow information to help decision makers support tribal water needs.</p>
<p>The National Water Quality Program increase of $3.5 million will enhance long-term surface- and groundwater-quality monitoring in Cycle 3 of the Program. This increase will further support cooperative and urban-waters activities by providing streamflow and water-quality data to state and local partners. The data are used to plan economic revitalization and restore urban waters. Additionally, the NWQP increase funds research to understand the effects of unconventional oil and gas extraction on streams and groundwater.</p>
<h3><strong>Natural Hazards</strong></h3>
<p>The FY 2017 USGS budget request for Natural Hazards includes a $10.7 million increase above the FY 2016 enacted level for a total of $149.7 million. It funds science to help protect the Nation&rsquo;s safety, security, and economic well-being, to make the United States more resilient to natural hazards, and to develop user driven tools to make communities safer.</p>
<p>The Earthquake Hazards Program increase of $1.7 million would fund induced seismicity research related to unconventional oil and gas production and improve earthquake monitoring by assuming long-term operations of about 160 seismographs in the Central and Eastern U.S. An additional $860,000 would fund sensors at select Global Seismographic Network sites. The budget continues funding of $8.2 million to implement a limited earthquake early warning system on the West Coast by expanding seismometer coverage outward around major urban areas, integrating fault slip data into the system, developing and testing the system to improve reliability, and end-user education efforts on how to understand and use alerts.</p>
<p>The Natural Hazards budget increase includes a Coastal and Marine Geology Program increase of $5.8 million, which would benefit coastal communities, including those in the Arctic, dealing with sea-level rise, severe storms, and melting permafrost. The increase would also fund research and modeling to apply findings from Hurricane Sandy to other parts of the U.S. coastline.</p>
<p>An increase of $1.7 million for the <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/faq/taxonomy/term/9782">Geomagnetism Program</a> would enhance USGS monitoring of electrical currents in the Earth&rsquo;s crust, and improve global magnetic field data. This monitoring by USGS is an integral component of the National Space Weather Strategy to protect against the harmful effects of magnetic storms. The Sun is always emitting a wind of electrically charged particles, but when a large sunspot emerges on the face of the Sun, there is an increased chance for abrupt emission of strong solar wind and a magnetic storm. An intense magnetic storm can affect many technological systems. In particular, storms can overload and interfere with the operation of electric-power grids on the Earth, sometimes causing blackouts.</p>
<p>In addition, an increase of $0.5 million in the Landslide Hazards Program would expand post-wildfire debris-flow hazard assessments and bolster the USGS capacity to respond to landslide crises.</p>
<h3><strong>Energy and Minerals Resources, and Environmental Health</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>The FY 2017 budget request for Energy and Minerals Resources, and Environmental Health<strong> (</strong>EMEH) is $5 million above the FY 2016 enacted level, for a total of $99.5 million. This includes a $1.6 million increase to the Mineral Resources Program for identifying and evaluating new sources of critical minerals and for new science and tools to reduce the impacts of minerals extraction, production, and recycling on the global environment and human health. The Energy Resources Program&rsquo;s proposed $1.4 million increase includes funds for unconventional oil and gas (UOG) research and assessments, evaluation of waters produced during UOG development, and assessments of undiscovered UOG on Alaska&rsquo;s North Slope. It funds scientific data-gathering needed for other domestic assessments of shale and tight oil and gas, geothermal energy research to support land management decisions about alternative energy permitting on Federal lands, and the application of an <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/pricing-the-priceless-ecosystem-services-science-at-usgs/">ecosystem services</a> approach to enhance resilience of coastal infrastructure and evaluate green infrastructure investments. These increases are partially offset by reductions to lower priority programs.</p>
<p>The increase includes an additional $3.1 million for Environmental Health research, with $1.3 million under the Contaminant Biology Program and $1.8 million under the Toxic Substances Hydrology Program. This research will assess potential biological effects of UOG on living organisms, including humans; study environmental contamination from spills and other releases of liquid and solid wastes from UOG development in West Virginia and North Dakota; and establish real-time water-quality monitoring along the northeast U.S. coast. These studies also will examine mercury and pesticide contamination in the Columbia River basin, and assess impacts of uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region. This research will inform decisions on new uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region.</p>
<h3><strong>Core Science Systems</strong></h3>
<p>The FY 2017 budget request for Core Science Systems is $6.8 million above the FY2016 enacted level, for a total of $118.4 million. Of the increase, $4.9 million would fund elevation data acquisition within the National Geospatial Program. This includes a $1.5 million increase to modernize mapping and collect ifsar (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) elevation data in Alaska. Improved mapping products are urgently needed in Alaska for aircraft navigation, since weather conditions deteriorate quickly and pilots frequently need to fly using only their instruments and GPS. It also includes $2.4 million to acquire lidar data (measuring distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing the reflected light) and enhance landscape-scale 3-D maps for the Nation. Accelerating national elevation data coverage will also enable decision making to manage infrastructure and construction, provide more accurate and cost effective application of chemicals in farming, help to develop energy resources, and support aviation safety and vehicle navigation. The proposed increase also provides $1 million to collect lidar data along the U.S. coast. These data help to understand and mitigate the effects of coastal erosion and storm surge and support management of the Chesapeake Bay. An additional increase of $1 million would complete the National Hydrography Database at a 1:24,000 scale for the conterminous 48 states, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This achievement would enable full integration of hydrography and elevation data in support of water resource managers throughout the Nation. The overall increase for Core Science Systems also funds research addressing pollinators and drought response.</p>
<h3><strong>Ecosystems</strong></h3>
<p>The FY 2017 USGS budget request for Ecosystems is $13.7 million above the FY 2016 enacted level for a total of $173.9 million. This includes a $4.9 million increase to the Environments Program for critical landscapes such as sage steppe and the Arctic. The increase for sage steppe supports the priority needs of managers to design conservation and management strategies for greater sage grouse; address changing fire regimes, drought and shifting climates; control the spread of invasive cheatgrass; and restore and manage the sage steppe landscape. The Arctic increase would fund research to inform communities and land managers about changes in the Arctic and how they affect the broader physical environment: altering stream flows, disrupting ocean currents and the fisheries that depend on them, changing ecosystems, and affecting the availability of resources. The Environments Program increase also funds research to support drought and wildfire response.</p>
<p>The Ecosystems budget request includes $3.2 million in new funding for the Fisheries Program to develop decision support tools for water ecology, to assess Great Lakes fisheries, and to process offshore samples that could provide an early warning for harmful algal blooms.</p>
<p>The budget increase for Ecosystems includes an additional $2.5 million under the Invasive Species Program for research on new and emerging invasive species of national concern and to develop and improve tools for early detection and control, such as advanced molecular detection of sea lamprey and other invasive species found at very low densities in the field.</p>
<p>The proposed Ecosystems increase also includes a $1.7 million increase through the Status and Trends Program for research to maintain native pollinators that help the Nation maintain its food supplies.</p>
<h3><strong>Climate and Land-Use Change</strong></h3>
<p>The FY 2017 USGS budget provides an increase of $31.5 million over the FY 2016 enacted level for Climate and Land-Use Change (CLU) research, for a total of $171.4 million. This includes a $15.4 million increase to develop the Landsat 9 ground system to accelerate the satellite&rsquo;s launch from 2023 to 2021 and to ensure access to the Nation&rsquo;s remote sensing data. An increase of $2.2 million would enable access to Sentinel-2 satellite data from the European Space Agency, and an increase of $3 million would allow the development of the computing and online storage resources necessary to rapidly produce and widely disseminate a set of Landsat-based information products.</p>
<p>The CLU increase also provides an additional $4.2 million to better understand patterns and manage the effects of drought. This includes new tools to better manage water nationwide such as near real-time satellite based drought monitoring. Drought impacts on natural and agricultural systems that would be assessed include soil moisture, evapotranspiration rates, vegetation response, and other metrics. The research would help water managers identify the onset and severity of drought events and effectively allocate scarce water resources. The increase includes $1.8 million for new tools to improve water management nationwide and use remote sensing to support additional aspects of the National Water Census.</p>
<p>The budget includes a $1.5 million increase to establish a Great Lakes Climate Science Center to help increase and improve focus on the many climate-related natural resource challenges in the Great Lakes region and a $1.4 million increase would fund work with tribes on climate adaptation. In addition, $2.4 million would go to critical landscape studies in the Arctic to develop predictive models of changes to the environment from the conversion of ice and snow to water and to estimate glacier loss in Alaska and potential changes in freshwater input. A $500,000 increase would fund imagery datasets and analytical tools for improved coastal resource management and planning for resilient coastal landscapes and communities.</p>
<p>The proposed USGS budget is part of the President&rsquo;s FY 2017 request of $13.4 billion for the Department of the Interior, reflecting his commitment to meet Federal trust responsibilities to Native Americans, conserve vital national landscapes across the Nation, support the next century of our public lands, and allow for responsible management of energy development on public lands and offshore areas.&nbsp;The Budget in Brief is online: <a href="http://www.doi.gov/budget">www.doi.gov/budget</a> and <a href="http://www.doi.gov/budget/2017/Hilites/toc.html">www.doi.gov/budget/2017/Hilites/toc.html</a>.</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:28:"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 14:00:00 EDT";s:6:"author";s:57:"OC_Web@usgs.gov (Office of Communications and Publishing)";s:7:"summary";s:17533:"

<p>The FY 2017 budget request for Core Science Systems is $6.8 million above the FY2016 enacted level, for a total of $118.4 million. Of the increase, $4.9 million would fund elevation data acquisition within the National Geospatial Program. This includes a $1.5 million increase to modernize mapping and collect ifsar (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) elevation data in Alaska. Improved mapping products are urgently needed in Alaska for aircraft navigation, since weather conditions deteriorate quickly and pilots frequently need to fly using only their instruments and GPS. It also includes $2.4 million to acquire lidar data (measuring distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing the reflected light) and enhance landscape-scale 3-D maps for the Nation. Accelerating national elevation data coverage will also enable decision making to manage infrastructure and construction, provide more accurate and cost effective application of chemicals in farming, help to develop energy resources, and support aviation safety and vehicle navigation. The proposed increase also provides $1 million to collect lidar data along the U.S. coast. These data help to understand and mitigate the effects of coastal erosion and storm surge and support management of the Chesapeake Bay. An additional increase of $1 million would complete the National Hydrography Database at a 1:24,000 scale for the conterminous 48 states, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This achievement would enable full integration of hydrography and elevation data in support of water resource managers throughout the Nation. The overall increase for Core Science Systems also funds research addressing pollinators and drought response.</p>
<h3><strong>Ecosystems</strong></h3>
<p>The FY 2017 USGS budget request for Ecosystems is $13.7 million above the FY 2016 enacted level for a total of $173.9 million. This includes a $4.9 million increase to the Environments Program for critical landscapes such as sage steppe and the Arctic. The increase for sage steppe supports the priority needs of managers to design conservation and management strategies for greater sage grouse; address changing fire regimes, drought and shifting climates; control the spread of invasive cheatgrass; and restore and manage the sage steppe landscape. The Arctic increase would fund research to inform communities and land managers about changes in the Arctic and how they affect the broader physical environment: altering stream flows, disrupting ocean currents and the fisheries that depend on them, changing ecosystems, and affecting the availability of resources. The Environments Program increase also funds research to support drought and wildfire response.</p>
<p>The Ecosystems budget request includes $3.2 million in new funding for the Fisheries Program to develop decision support tools for water ecology, to assess Great Lakes fisheries, and to process offshore samples that could provide an early warning for harmful algal blooms.</p>
<p>The budget increase for Ecosystems includes an additional $2.5 million under the Invasive Species Program for research on new and emerging invasive species of national concern and to develop and improve tools for early detection and control, such as advanced molecular detection of sea lamprey and other invasive species found at very low densities in the field.</p>
<p>The proposed Ecosystems increase also includes a $1.7 million increase through the Status and Trends Program for research to maintain native pollinators that help the Nation maintain its food supplies.</p>
<h3><strong>Climate and Land-Use Change</strong></h3>
<p>The FY 2017 USGS budget provides an increase of $31.5 million over the FY 2016 enacted level for Climate and Land-Use Change (CLU) research, for a total of $171.4 million. This includes a $15.4 million increase to develop the Landsat 9 ground system to accelerate the satellite&rsquo;s launch from 2023 to 2021 and to ensure access to the Nation&rsquo;s remote sensing data. An increase of $2.2 million would enable access to Sentinel-2 satellite data from the European Space Agency, and an increase of $3 million would allow the development of the computing and online storage resources necessary to rapidly produce and widely disseminate a set of Landsat-based information products.</p>
<p>The CLU increase also provides an additional $4.2 million to better understand patterns and manage the effects of drought. This includes new tools to better manage water nationwide such as near real-time satellite based drought monitoring. Drought impacts on natural and agricultural systems that would be assessed include soil moisture, evapotranspiration rates, vegetation response, and other metrics. The research would help water managers identify the onset and severity of drought events and effectively allocate scarce water resources. The increase includes $1.8 million for new tools to improve water management nationwide and use remote sensing to support additional aspects of the National Water Census.</p>
<p>The budget includes a $1.5 million increase to establish a Great Lakes Climate Science Center to help increase and improve focus on the many climate-related natural resource challenges in the Great Lakes region and a $1.4 million increase would fund work with tribes on climate adaptation. In addition, $2.4 million would go to critical landscape studies in the Arctic to develop predictive models of changes to the environment from the conversion of ice and snow to water and to estimate glacier loss in Alaska and potential changes in freshwater input. A $500,000 increase would fund imagery datasets and analytical tools for improved coastal resource management and planning for resilient coastal landscapes and communities.</p>
<p>The proposed USGS budget is part of the President&rsquo;s FY 2017 request of $13.4 billion for the Department of the Interior, reflecting his commitment to meet Federal trust responsibilities to Native Americans, conserve vital national landscapes across the Nation, support the next century of our public lands, and allow for responsible management of energy development on public lands and offshore areas.&nbsp;The Budget in Brief is online: <a href="http://www.doi.gov/budget">www.doi.gov/budget</a> and <a href="http://www.doi.gov/budget/2017/Hilites/toc.html">www.doi.gov/budget/2017/Hilites/toc.html</a>.</p>";}i:8;a:8:{s:5:"title";s:43:"The National Map Data Download Enhancements";s:8:"category";s:161:"TACoreScienceSystemsNationalGeospatial TheNationalMap

<p>3) Click on the &ldquo;Find Product&rsquo; button to get search results</p>
<p>4) You will then be presented with a .CSV file to directly download or add to a cart if you want additional products</p>
<p>5) You can order multiple National Map products from this client but it is easiest to go through the steps for each product line you want to order, one product at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Download Manager<br /></strong><a href="http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/apps/download_manager/">Download Manager</a> is a Java-based application that runs on your local computer and enables download of multiple products without requiring the user to click each individual download link.&nbsp; If you require lots of data, export all the search results into a .CSV file and use the &lsquo;Download Manager&rsquo; application for fast behind the scenes data retrieval while working on other activities.</p>
<p><strong>Large Scale Contours are available<br /></strong>The contours created from The National Map US Topo program are now included in a dynamic <a href="http://services.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Contours/MapServer">contours map service</a>. This new service has dynamic layers enabled to allow user-defined custom styling to be applied in Esri<sup>&reg;</sup> clients.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Style Control is enabled on vector map services<br /></strong>Users can take advantage of dynamic style control on The National Map <a href="http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/services/">vector web services</a>. This feature enables users to change the color and line weight of our vectors to best meet their mapping and visualization needs, without having to download the actual dataset.</p>
<p><strong>File GeoDatabase 9.3.1 format retired<br /></strong>In addition to these new enhancements, some of the existing file formats and capabilities will be retired over the next few months.

<p>Reston, VA &ndash; Inland capture fisheries are much more crucial to global food security than realized, according to the first global <a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/er-2015-0064">review</a> of the value of inland fish and fisheries.</p>
<p>The article, published today in <em>Environmental Reviews</em>, showed that although aquaculture and inland capture fisheries contribute more than 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s reported finfish production, their harvest is greatly under-reported and value is often-ignored.</p>
<p>Inland waters, which comprise about 0.01 percent of the earth&rsquo;s water, are lakes, rivers, streams, canals, reservoirs and other land-locked waters.</p>
<p>Topping the list of the value of inland fish and fisheries is food and economic security: these fisheries provide food for billions of people and livelihoods for millions worldwide. They are a primary animal protein consumed by many of the world&rsquo;s rural poor, especially those in developing countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inland capture fisheries and aquaculture are fundamental to food security globally,&rdquo; said Abigail Lynch, a fisheries research biologist with the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center.&nbsp; &ldquo;In many areas of the world, these fisheries are a last resort when primary income sources fail due to, for instance, economic shifts, war, natural disasters and water development projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inland fisheries, the review showed, support at least 21 million fishers, many of whom live in low-income countries and rely on these fisheries for both subsistence and their livelihood.</p>
<p>Other important benefits that inland fisheries and aquaculture provide include recreation, cultural and even spiritual values, and their contribution to species&rsquo; and ecosystem diversity. Because sustainable inland aquaculture is more efficient, it is also often &ldquo;greener&rdquo; than raising poultry, pigs or cows.</p>
<p>The authors cautioned, however, that inland fisheries are more important than current research is able to document because harvest amounts are vastly underestimated, particularly in remote areas and in developing countries. For example, only one-third of countries with inland fisheries submit catch statistics to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The limitations to valuing the benefits that inland fish and fisheries provide make it difficult to incorporate them into resource planning on a national or global scale, author Carleton University&rsquo;s Steve Cooke noted. &ldquo;What is of great concern is that more than half of the inland fisheries&rsquo; habitat is moderately or highly threatened, so populations may be lost even before they are documented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The article, &ldquo;The social, economic, and environmental importance of inland fish and fisheries,&rdquo; was authored by Abigail Lynch, USGS; Steven Cooke, Carleton University; Andrew Deines, Michigan State University, and others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reston, VA &ndash; Inland capture fisheries are much more crucial to global food security than realized, according to the first global <a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/er-2015-0064">review</a> of the value of inland fish and fisheries.</p>
<p>The article, published today in <em>Environmental Reviews</em>, showed that although aquaculture and inland capture fisheries contribute more than 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s reported finfish production, their harvest is greatly under-reported and value is often-ignored.</p>
<p>Inland waters, which comprise about 0.01 percent of the earth&rsquo;s water, are lakes, rivers, streams, canals, reservoirs and other land-locked waters.</p>
<p>Topping the list of the value of inland fish and fisheries is food and economic security: these fisheries provide food for billions of people and livelihoods for millions worldwide. They are a primary animal protein consumed by many of the world&rsquo;s rural poor, especially those in developing countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inland capture fisheries and aquaculture are fundamental to food security globally,&rdquo; said Abigail Lynch, a fisheries research biologist with the USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center.&nbsp; &ldquo;In many areas of the world, these fisheries are a last resort when primary income sources fail due to, for instance, economic shifts, war, natural disasters and water development projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inland fisheries, the review showed, support at least 21 million fishers, many of whom live in low-income countries and rely on these fisheries for both subsistence and their livelihood.</p>
<p>Other important benefits that inland fisheries and aquaculture provide include recreation, cultural and even spiritual values, and their contribution to species&rsquo; and ecosystem diversity. Because sustainable inland aquaculture is more efficient, it is also often &ldquo;greener&rdquo; than raising poultry, pigs or cows.</p>
<p>The authors cautioned, however, that inland fisheries are more important than current research is able to document because harvest amounts are vastly underestimated, particularly in remote areas and in developing countries. For example, only one-third of countries with inland fisheries submit catch statistics to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The limitations to valuing the benefits that inland fish and fisheries provide make it difficult to incorporate them into resource planning on a national or global scale, author Carleton University&rsquo;s Steve Cooke noted. &ldquo;What is of great concern is that more than half of the inland fisheries&rsquo; habitat is moderately or highly threatened, so populations may be lost even before they are documented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The article, &ldquo;The social, economic, and environmental importance of inland fish and fisheries,&rdquo; was authored by Abigail Lynch, USGS; Steven Cooke, Carleton University; Andrew Deines, Michigan State University, and others.&nbsp;</p>

The USGS will also require that data used to support the findings be available free to the public when the associated study is published.</p>
<p>The plan applies to research papers and data authored or co-authored by USGS, contract employees, award or grant recipients, partners and other entities.

<p>The plan responds to a February 2013 Office of Science and Technology Policy memorandum that directed federal agencies with annual research and development budgets above $100 million to increase public access to peer-reviewed scientific publications and digital data resulting from federally funded research.

Digital data will be available in machine readable form from the <a href="http://data.usgs.gov/">USGS Science Data Catalog</a>. The plan will require the inclusion of data management plans in all new research proposals and grants.</p>

<p>USGS geologists mapping Alaska&rsquo;s south coast shortly after the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake had speculated that a submarine landslide might have triggered the Chenega tsunami, just as known landslides triggered tsunamis that devastated the Alaskan towns of Valdez, Seward and Whittier. But &ldquo;a bathymetric survey at the time, which only imaged relatively shallow seafloor, down to 180 meters (330 feet) deep, did not reveal evidence of a landslide in nearby Dangerous Passage or the other waterways around Chenega. Alternate explanations involving seafloor movement during the earthquake did not fit the timing and severity of the Chenega tsunami as described by eyewitnesses,&rdquo; explained Daniel Brothers, USGS geophysicist and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>The tsunami origin remained uncertain until a team led by Brothers mapped a large submarine landslide complex in Dangerous Passage, mostly in water deeper than what was <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0542g/pp542g_text.pdf">studied in 1964</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes this slide unusual is that much of the material that slid was at a water depth of 250 to 350 meters (820 to 1150 feet),&rdquo; said Peter Haeussler, USGS geologist and a coauthor of the report. &ldquo;The deeper initiation depth made it particularly good at generating a tsunami.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientists used multibeam sonar technology to collect high-resolution bathymetric (seafloor depth) data, and a single-channel seismic-reflection system to collect sub-bottom profiles (cross-sectional views of sedimentary layers and other features beneath the seafloor).</p>
<p>The researchers calculated the time it would take for a tsunami triggered by a large landslide in the mapped areas to reach the village of Chenega and found a good fit with eyewitness reports: a tsunami wave triggered in the areas where they found landslide evidence would take three to four minutes to reach the village, consistent with the arrival time of the most destructive waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is exciting to see the technology evolve so we can now get high-resolution images of the seafloor that we could not back then and to pinpoint the most likely source for the waves. After 50 years, this new work confirms our original inference that it was probably landslide-generated waves that devastated Chenega so many years ago, but we had no adequate submarine data to define either the size or location of the landslide sources,&rdquo; said USGS geologist emeritus George Plafker who, with colleague Larry Mayo, was one of the first responders and wrote some of the <a href="http://pubs.dggsalaskagov.us/webpubs/usgs/of/text/of65-0124.pdf">early geological field reports</a> on surface effects of the Chenega waves&nbsp;in 1965.</p>
<p>The modern bathymetric data revealed three sedimentary basins at progressively deeper levels toward the open waters of Prince William Sound. These basins were originally carved by descending glaciers when sea level was lower. As sea level rose and the glaciers retreated after the last ice age, the basins filled with sediment eroded and washed off the land. The basins are separated by sills, likely terminal glacial moraines, and bounded by steep, rugged slopes. Details of the underwater terrain include scarps, blocks, hummocky surfaces and other features typical of landslides. Similarly, the sub-bottom seismic profiles show that the basins are filled with fine-grained sediment, with layers disrupted in ways that indicate multiple landslides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new report by USGS scientists and their colleagues from Boise State University and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16000157">A submarine landslide source for the devastating 1964 Chenega tsunami, southern Alaska</a>,&rdquo; was published in the journal, Earth and Planetary Science Letters.</p>

<br>	<p>Minutes after the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/alaska1964/">1964 magnitude-9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake</a> began shaking, a series of tsunami waves swept through the village of Chenega in Prince William Sound, destroying all but two of the buildings and killing 23 of the 75 inhabitants. Fifty years later, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey revealed the likely cause of the tsunami, a large set of underwater landslides. The scientists used detailed seafloor images not only clear up a decades-old mystery, but also underscore the tsunami hazard that submarine landslides can pose in fjords around the world where communities and ports are commonly located.</p>

<p>USGS geologists mapping Alaska&rsquo;s south coast shortly after the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake had speculated that a submarine landslide might have triggered the Chenega tsunami, just as known landslides triggered tsunamis that devastated the Alaskan towns of Valdez, Seward and Whittier. But &ldquo;a bathymetric survey at the time, which only imaged relatively shallow seafloor, down to 180 meters (330 feet) deep, did not reveal evidence of a landslide in nearby Dangerous Passage or the other waterways around Chenega. Alternate explanations involving seafloor movement during the earthquake did not fit the timing and severity of the Chenega tsunami as described by eyewitnesses,&rdquo; explained Daniel Brothers, USGS geophysicist and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>The tsunami origin remained uncertain until a team led by Brothers mapped a large submarine landslide complex in Dangerous Passage, mostly in water deeper than what was <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0542g/pp542g_text.pdf">studied in 1964</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes this slide unusual is that much of the material that slid was at a water depth of 250 to 350 meters (820 to 1150 feet),&rdquo; said Peter Haeussler, USGS geologist and a coauthor of the report. &ldquo;The deeper initiation depth made it particularly good at generating a tsunami.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientists used multibeam sonar technology to collect high-resolution bathymetric (seafloor depth) data, and a single-channel seismic-reflection system to collect sub-bottom profiles (cross-sectional views of sedimentary layers and other features beneath the seafloor).</p>
<p>The researchers calculated the time it would take for a tsunami triggered by a large landslide in the mapped areas to reach the village of Chenega and found a good fit with eyewitness reports: a tsunami wave triggered in the areas where they found landslide evidence would take three to four minutes to reach the village, consistent with the arrival time of the most destructive waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is exciting to see the technology evolve so we can now get high-resolution images of the seafloor that we could not back then and to pinpoint the most likely source for the waves. After 50 years, this new work confirms our original inference that it was probably landslide-generated waves that devastated Chenega so many years ago, but we had no adequate submarine data to define either the size or location of the landslide sources,&rdquo; said USGS geologist emeritus George Plafker who, with colleague Larry Mayo, was one of the first responders and wrote some of the <a href="http://pubs.dggsalaskagov.us/webpubs/usgs/of/text/of65-0124.pdf">early geological field reports</a> on surface effects of the Chenega waves&nbsp;in 1965.</p>
<p>The modern bathymetric data revealed three sedimentary basins at progressively deeper levels toward the open waters of Prince William Sound. These basins were originally carved by descending glaciers when sea level was lower. As sea level rose and the glaciers retreated after the last ice age, the basins filled with sediment eroded and washed off the land. The basins are separated by sills, likely terminal glacial moraines, and bounded by steep, rugged slopes. Details of the underwater terrain include scarps, blocks, hummocky surfaces and other features typical of landslides. Similarly, the sub-bottom seismic profiles show that the basins are filled with fine-grained sediment, with layers disrupted in ways that indicate multiple landslides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new report by USGS scientists and their colleagues from Boise State University and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16000157">A submarine landslide source for the devastating 1964 Chenega tsunami, southern Alaska</a>,&rdquo; was published in the journal, Earth and Planetary Science Letters.</p>

<br><p>Boaters, swimmers or other members of the public who see Lionfish, Asian carp, Zebra mussels or any other invasive or non-native plant or animal species have two options to report sightings.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sightings nationwide should now be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usgs.gov/stopans." target="_blank">reported online</a>&nbsp;to the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://nas.er.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program,</a>&nbsp;called the NAS, or directly <a href="http://www.fws.gov/fisheries/NAS_Hotline.html">to state government natural resource agencies</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public has been able to report sightings to the USGS and state agencies for some time, but with the discontinuation of a federal reporting Aquatic Nuisance Species hotline&nbsp;late last year researchers are trying to get the word out on the updated reporting system and the continued importance of reporting sightings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty-seven percent of the invasive species alerts in the past five years have been based on information reported by the public,&rdquo; said Pam Fuller, a fish biologist with USGS and the leader of the NAS Program. &ldquo;We rely on the public to gather much of our data on aquatic invasive species. We depend on them to be our &lsquo;early detectors.&rsquo; When you combine the information we receive from reported sightings with information we pull from other sources, we&rsquo;re able to provide a national picture of species distribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For 19 years, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.anstaskforce.gov/default.php" target="_blank">Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force</a>&nbsp;operated a 24-hour phone hotline available to report sightings. In recent years, the line was seldom used, with sightings being more often than not reported via email, prompting the change in process. Scientists say reporting sightings is still very important, and very easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New occurrences of non-native aquatic species are occurring more frequently than people think,&rdquo; said Fuller. &ldquo;In the past 12 months, we&rsquo;ve seen 110 new occurrences. This includes both new species, as well as species we&rsquo;ve already seen that are just in new locations. Identifying where these species are being seen can help us predict which regions may be susceptible to invasion, and can help prioritize management needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nearly four-decade old NAS database monitors, analyzes, and records non-native aquatic animals, including mussels, snails, crayfish, turtles, frogs, and fish, and now, aquatic plants, to give a more comprehensive understanding of the occurrence of non-native and invasive species in the United States. The database is freely accessible to the public, allowing users to view current distributions, search for particular regions and species, and report sightings of non-native and invasive aquatic species. Information from the data is used to generate scientific reports, real-time online queries, spatial data sets, regional contact lists, fact sheets and occurrence alerts.</p>
<p>In 2004, an&nbsp;<a href="https://nas.er.usgs.gov/AlertSystem/Register.aspx" target="_blank">alert function</a>&nbsp;was added to the system to send out alerts to users anytime a new species was introduced into an area. The system offers timely information to environmental managers to help them prioritize and initiate monitoring and management actions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The NAS program monitors nonindigenous species, also known as non-native species or species not historically found in an area, as well as invasive species. A non-native species is not necessarily invasive; however, once a population is able to sustain itself it is considered invasive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The NAS program works with state and federal natural resource agencies to gather information on non-native and invasive aquatic species, and works with other partners to develop tools, including integrated reporting and filtered website views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been numerous instances when a species was reported to us and we notified the state biologists who went out to investigate,&rdquo; said Fuller. &ldquo;Sometimes the reports turn out to be new introductions, and sometimes they are misidentifications. But when in doubt &ndash; report it.&rdquo;</p>

<br>	<p>In 2015, United States mines produced an estimated $78.3 billion of mineral raw materials&mdash;down 3percent from $80.8 billion in 2014, the U.S. Geological Survey announced today in its <em>Mineral Commodity Summaries 2016</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decision-makers and policy-makers in the private and public sectors rely on the Mineral Commodity Summaries and other USGS minerals information publications as unbiased sources of information to make business decisions and national policy,&rdquo; said Steven M.

<p>This annual report from the USGS is the earliest comprehensive source of 2015 mineral production data for the world. It includes statistics on about 90 mineral commodities that are essential to the U.S. economy and national security, and addresses events, trends, and issues in the domestic and international minerals industries. Industries consuming such processed non-fuel mineral materials&mdash;such as cement, steel, brick, and fertilizer, et cetera&mdash;added $2.49 trillion or 14 percent to the total U.S. Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p>In 2015, the U.S. was 100 percent import reliant on 19 mineral commodities, including rare earths, manganese, and bauxite, which are among a suite of materials often designated as &ldquo;critical&rdquo; or &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; because they are essential to the economy and their supply may be disrupted. Though the U.S. was also 100 percent import reliant on 19 mineral commodities in 2014, this number has risen from just 7 commodities in 1978.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dependence on foreign sources of critical minerals illustrates both the interdependency of the global community and a growing concern about the adequacy of mineral resources supplies for future generations.&nbsp; Will our children&rsquo;s children have the resources they need to live the lives that we all want?&rdquo; asked Larry Meinert, MRP program coordinator.</p>
<p>A reduction in construction activity began with the 2008-09 recession and continued through 2011. However, construction spending continued to increase in 2015&mdash;more than 10 percent compared to 2014, which benefitted the industrial minerals and aggregates sectors.</p>
<p>Production of 14 mineral commodities was worth more than $1 billion each in the United States in 2015, the same as in 2014. The estimated value of U.S. industrial minerals&nbsp; production in 2015 was $51.7 billion, 4 percent more than that of 2014.</p>
<p>Declining demand for metals&mdash;especially in China, reduced investment demand, and increase global inventories resulted in decreasing prices and production for most metals.&nbsp; In fact, several U.S. metal mines idled in 2015, including the only U.S. rare earth mine at Mountain Pass, California. Rare earths are vital components in modern technologies like smart phones, light-emitting-diode (LED) lights, and flat screen televisions, as well as clean energy and defense technologies.</p>
<p>The estimated value of U.S. metal mine production in 2015 was $26.6 billion, 15 percent less than that of 2014. These raw materials and domestically recycled materials were used to process mineral materials worth $630 billion, a 4 percent decrease from $659 billion in 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, 14 states each produced more than $2 billion worth of nonfuel mineral commodities. These states were, in descending order of value&mdash;Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, California, Alaska, Utah, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Colorado, Wyoming, and Illinois. Wisconsin and Illinois are new to the list in 2015.</p>
<p>The USGS Mineral Resources Program delivers unbiased science and information to understand mineral resource potential, production, consumption, and how minerals interact with the environment. The USGS National Minerals Information Center collects, analyzes, and disseminates current information on the supply of and the demand for minerals and materials in the United States and about 180 other countries. This information is essential in planning for and mitigating impacts of potential disruptions to mineral commodity supply due to both natural hazard and man-made events.</p>
