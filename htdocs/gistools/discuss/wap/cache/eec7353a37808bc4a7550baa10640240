Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at UC Irvine, said their premise was wrong, noting that they are grossly overestimating the infection rate due to statistical bias.“They’re advancing factual inaccuracies and playing off the esoteric nature of the mortality stats to make a case that the economy should be reopened,” Noymer told The Californian. “I agree it should be reopened, but it should be opened deliberately, bit by bit, and informed by science. Not informed by a misreading of the mortality.”Carlson continued to dismiss nationwide physical distancing guidelines as having played any role in helping to flatten the curve of the spread of the virus, which he again insisted was not so dangerous.“Six weeks later we are happy to say that curve has been flattened, but it’s likely not because of the lockdowns,” he proclaimed. “The virus just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was, all of us, including on this show. Everybody thought it was, but it turned out not to be.”Carlson, who in early March appeared to call out both Trump and his Fox News colleagues for minimizing the severity of the coronavirus, has become in recent weeks one of the loudest voices at Fox calling for an end to stay-at-home restrictions in order to restart the economy.His network, meanwhile, recently cut ties with pro-Trump vlogging superstars Diamond & Silk, largely as a result of their peddling of conspiracy theories and disinformation about the coronavirus, including claims that the virus is not so deadly and that people should purposely get infected to gain immunity.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

And I think that kind of dialogue will happen.”Trump, however, attempted to claim on Friday that he was posing the question about disinfectants “sarcastically” to reporters in the Thursday briefing “just to see what would happen.”Birx went on to lament that “what got lost” is that the Department of Homeland Security study that the president touted showed that sunlight can impact the aerosolization of the virus, prompting Tapper to point out that Trump was not “musing” about the factual findings of the study.“He was talking about ways to take that science and somehow turn it into injecting UV light or disinfectants into the human body which as you know, especially with disinfectants, can be lethal,” the anchor added, noting the CDC and disinfectant manufacturers have had to issue statements.“As a doctor, doesn’t that bother you, that you have to even spend any time discussing this?” Tapper pressed Birx.“Well, I think it bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we’re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people, to continue to protect one another,” she replied.Grousing that spending time on Trump’s remarks prevents her and other scientists from getting more important information out to the American public, she asserted that the president wasn’t peddling dangerous misinformation.“I think the president made it clear that physicians had to study this,” Birx stated. “I think I’ve made it clear that this was a musing, as you described.”In a Saturday night Fox News appearance, Birx told host Jesse Watters that she didn’t believe Trump had placed anyone in danger, claiming the president “likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue.”In another interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Birx continued to promote the DHS study while insisting that she had already made it “very clear” that she has clarified that ingesting bleach is “not a treatment” for coronavirus. Asked by anchor Chuck Todd whether she was worried that Trump’s comments and touting of unproven cures were undermining the credibility of task force scientists, Birx largely avoided the question.“I think all of us are very clear and very clear in our discussions with the American people how we’re looking and utilizing data to drive decision making within the task force,” she said, adding: “We need to constantly be focusing on what we’re learning to save more lives and to make our treatment more effective.”Bix essentially giving Trump a pass while touting the DHS study, which hasn’t been peer-reviewed, prompted NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell to blast the doctor for helping to propagate misinformation.“I think the credibility of the scientists really now is on the line,” Mitchell said on Meet the Press. &quot;When Dr. Birx said to you today that sunlight does kill the virus, she is perpetuating an unscientific, untested, single study presented by a nonscientist from the Department of Homeland Security, which led to the president, as she put it, not fully digesting the data,” she added. “She needed to be very clear on disavowing it, and to this point, she still has not been even this morning.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

And I think that kind of dialogue will happen.”Trump, however, attempted to claim on Friday that he was posing the question about disinfectants “sarcastically” to reporters in the Thursday briefing “just to see what would happen.”Birx went on to lament that “what got lost” is that the Department of Homeland Security study that the president touted showed that sunlight can impact the aerosolization of the virus, prompting Tapper to point out that Trump was not “musing” about the factual findings of the study.“He was talking about ways to take that science and somehow turn it into injecting UV light or disinfectants into the human body which as you know, especially with disinfectants, can be lethal,” the anchor added, noting the CDC and disinfectant manufacturers have had to issue statements.“As a doctor, doesn’t that bother you, that you have to even spend any time discussing this?” Tapper pressed Birx.“Well, I think it bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we’re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people, to continue to protect one another,” she replied.Grousing that spending time on Trump’s remarks prevents her and other scientists from getting more important information out to the American public, she asserted that the president wasn’t peddling dangerous misinformation.“I think the president made it clear that physicians had to study this,” Birx stated. “I think I’ve made it clear that this was a musing, as you described.”In a Saturday night Fox News appearance, Birx told host Jesse Watters that she didn’t believe Trump had placed anyone in danger, claiming the president “likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue.”In another interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Birx continued to promote the DHS study while insisting that she had already made it “very clear” that she has clarified that ingesting bleach is “not a treatment” for coronavirus. Asked by anchor Chuck Todd whether she was worried that Trump’s comments and touting of unproven cures were undermining the credibility of task force scientists, Birx largely avoided the question.“I think all of us are very clear and very clear in our discussions with the American people how we’re looking and utilizing data to drive decision making within the task force,” she said, adding: “We need to constantly be focusing on what we’re learning to save more lives and to make our treatment more effective.”Bix essentially giving Trump a pass while touting the DHS study, which hasn’t been peer-reviewed, prompted NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell to blast the doctor for helping to propagate misinformation.“I think the credibility of the scientists really now is on the line,” Mitchell said on Meet the Press. &quot;When Dr. Birx said to you today that sunlight does kill the virus, she is perpetuating an unscientific, untested, single study presented by a nonscientist from the Department of Homeland Security, which led to the president, as she put it, not fully digesting the data,” she added. “She needed to be very clear on disavowing it, and to this point, she still has not been even this morning.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.
