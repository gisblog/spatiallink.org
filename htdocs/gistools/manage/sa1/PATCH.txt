How to Install a Sugar Patch
----------------------------

IMPORTANT! Before beginning the upgrade process, it is imperative 
to perform a backup of the Sugar directory structure and the database.

If you have customized parts of Sugar, please check for any patched files that
would overwrite your changes.

- unzip the SugarXXX-Patch.zip
- go into the directory the unzip creates, SugarXXX-Patch
- there will be at least one directory, also called SugarXXX-Patch
- the contents of the innermost SugarXXX-Patch directory should be copied over
    into your existing sugar application directory.
