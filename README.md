### spatiallink.org - spatiallink_org aimed to be a meetup.com for GIS pros (2004) [ARCHIVED] ###

This was a custom Linux-Apache(2)-MySQL(4)-PHP(5) CMS. In 2020, MySQL was upgraded from 5.x to 8.x and PHP from 5.x to 7.x, and the site migrated to AWS. Archived as part of Long Tail.

See "Half-life of a Website" (2005) at gisblog.org -
* "The very first thing the website did was send out a header depending on the client-browser. This was recommended when, say, different protocols were used to access the website. Note that this step got initiated only after the Apache Webserver had finished running through its configuration directives. The website then marked the start-time for script downloads and executions. Measuring script download and execution times helped in diagnostics. The website also went down a list of red-flags checking for browser compatibility and permission-settings. Later, it established connections with MySQL databases and fetched or defined client and script variables."
* "Only then did the layout begin to emerge with some CSS, X/HTML and plenty of include files. Care was taken to separate presentation which had been kept to a minimum given the volunteer nature of the website, from content and function, and make it easier to reuse data. To display news feeds, the website fetched the feed URL and sliced its content into nodes. Sometimes feed URLs did not provide information as desired. For example, a feed URL may not have provided a direct hyperlink to its article. Sometimes a feed URL included an image-path in its description that needed to be dropped. For such cases, string-manipulation functions were used. It was advisable to ensure that the website continued to parse in a timely manner even if the fetching failed."
* "The website then wrapped-up logging of relevant variables and closed open database connections. If script execution had generated any errors, a summary was emailed. The website then spit-out the footer - Its decay into dead text was finally complete […well, unless there was AJAX to monitor client-behavior].
A quick note on the website maintenance: Given its volunteer nature, it was maintained in small nudges i.e. “minor increments made frequently”, with the emphasis being on function over form."
